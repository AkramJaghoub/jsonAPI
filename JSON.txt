It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three. It was another disappointing game for Van Dijk as he rounded off his 2023-24 season with a defeat, the pair will not join up with their teammates for international duty until September.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 17:04:51","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26724153.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_rafjpeg.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton want to sign England int'l for free amid Friday Arsenal news - report","link":"https://www.goodisonnews.com/2023/06/18/everton-transfer-news-ainsley-maitland-niles-targeted-after-confirmed-arsenal-exit/","keywords":["News","Players","Transfers","Ainsley Maitland-Niles","Arsenal","everton"],"creator":["George Overhill"],"video_url":null,"description":"Everton are targeting Ainsley Maitland-Niles again after the England international’s exit from Arsenal, according to Football Transfers.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul. Following on from his comments about his \"little brother\", the 24-year-old has added fuel to the fire that is the speculation surrounding his fellow Frenchman. In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work. He's still very young but he has an incredible margin for improvement so I'm confident.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:49:42","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27148241.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_konatethuram2.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Why Marty Walsh left the Biden administration to run the NHL players' union","link":"https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/national-sports/why-marty-walsh-left-the-biden-administration-to-run-the-nhl-players-union/","keywords":["National Sports","AP Sports"],"creator":["STEPHEN WHYNO, Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"Marty Walsh wasn't a man in a hurry to leave the Biden administration.

Less than halfway through the president’s term, Walsh was in a comfortable spot in the Cabinet as labor secretary. Then he got a call about an interesting opportunity: running the NHL Players’ Association. The former mayor of Boston and longtime Bruins fan was intrigued and earlier this year accepted the role as executive director. Now three months in, Walsh is trying to get to know players and what they care about most, learning about everything from the Arizona Coyotes’ arena situation to the salary cap and future international competition. “This job is more like being the mayor,” Walsh said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press during the Stanley Cup Final in Las Vegas. “You wake up in the morning, you’re planning on a smooth day and there’s an issue that pops, and that’s the issue of the moment. And then when that issue’s over, there’s another issue that comes right behind it. And if there’s a celebration on anything, that celebration’s short-lived because you’re on to the next issue.” With the current collective bargaining agreement in place through the 2025-26 season, the most pressing issue concerns the Coyotes, set to go into a second season in a 5,000-seat rink on Arizona State’s campus after a referendum for a new arena in Tempe failed. Walsh has met more with Arizona’s players than anyone else among the nearly 200 members he has spoken to so far. “These are National Hockey League players playing in a college arena,” Walsh said. “Players that are heading into the prime of their career now playing in this arena for a couple seasons — it’s just not right. It’s not good for the game.” When Walsh speaks to players, he finds out what they think is good or not so good for the game. Many, like Connor McDavid, prioritize returning to the Olympics after a lengthy absence and getting a World Cup of Hockey on the schedule, while others are more concerned with the cap going up and keeping escrow payments down. Several months after helping the U.S. avert a nationwide rail strike, this job hearkens back to the days when Walsh was president of the Laborers’ Union Local 223 in Massachusetts. With players aged 18-38 in various stages of their careers, he said the NHLPA membership is diverse in what it cares about, just like any other workplace. “One thing I’ve learned quickly is that this truly is a union because every player has a different concern,” Walsh said. “And I think it’s important for me to get to know the membership so I can represent them the best I can, understanding the challenges they have.” Walsh, 56, also has gotten to know Commissioner Gary Bettman since taking over in March. They attended an event together at the Canadian Embassy in Washington in April and have met several times to discuss the cap, the Coyotes and more. “To me, the vital signs seem good,” Bettman told the AP recently. “We’re getting better acquainted. I like him. I respect him. I think he’s smart. I think he’s going to be good for the players, and I look forward to working with him.” Walsh called it a “very cordial working relationship,” while acknowledging there will be disagreements ahead “that put us on two different sides of a fence — and we will have to deal with that when the time comes.” Collective bargaining talks in the coming years almost certainly will bring that conflict. Kevin Shattenkirk, a veteran defenseman who was on the search committee, said Walsh was engaging and commanding right away and gave out his cellphone number to players to call any time after his first interview. “Part of his pitch was that he was going to be readily available to players at any moment — any time that we needed him,” Shattenkirk said Sunday. “With his experience in working in labor unions, I think he knows how important that is. It’s important for the head of it to be accessible and also at the same time to be strong and powerful and know which way he’s leading his organization.” For now, Walsh is trying to lead the way in preparing players for life after hockey and growing the game beyond the nearly $6 billion in revenue. He watches football, basketball and baseball differently since shifting from politics to sports, thinking about what other leagues have done and how it might apply to the NHL. Walsh is a fan of increasing interest in Sweden and other places in Europe with games there and wonders about opportunities for hockey in Latin American countries and among underserved populations in North America. “We have teams like the Dallas Stars and the Coyotes and even the (Florida) Panthers to some degree: large Latino populations,” Walsh said. “You think of Boston — are we tapping into Latino population in Boston, New York, Chicago, places like that?” Just getting a chance to tackle tasks like that excites Walsh, who said he still has a very strong, close friendship with Joe Biden. The president, when Walsh left in February, called him “one tough union chief” and a model for future labor secretaries. This is just a different challenge, one that Walsh feels his entire career has prepared him for. “There’s not many opportunities that probably could have come on my plate that I would’ve been like, ’Oh, this is perfect,’” he said. “This is kind of my whole life coming full circle: labor movement, running a union, opportunities to grow the game, to be progressive in thinking as to how do we grow the game, how do we strengthen the union.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

More than 200 features, shorts, animated, experimental and immersive programs have screened at Tribeca, New York’s largest film festival, held annually in Lower Manhattan since 2002. The festival took place in two dimensions. The first was traditionally represented by public screenings in several cinemas with the presence of the creators of the strips, who answered questions from the public after the screenings. The second, related to the pandemic, invited fans to stream on their computers, tablets and iPhones. For the first time on such a scale, Tribeca has opened up the opportunity for “couch” viewing fans to get acquainted with the show’s schedule, of course, for a fee. The other side of glory “Cipher” won Best American Narrative Film, and the award went to director Chris Moukarbel, who isn’t new to the theme song. He has already made several music videos. Her first feature-length documentary, Me @ The Zoo, premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Cipher, his acting debut, starred 27-year-old Tierra Wack. She first rose to prominence at the age of 15, when she stood on the streets in Philadelphia and sang rap verses for a YouTube channel with unusual expressiveness. Tierra Wack Cipher Star. Credit: AP Today, Wack is a celebrity in the latest hip-hop music subculture. She is admired by celebrities such as Erika Badu and Billie Eilish. But, as Moukarbel’s camera testifies, there is a downside to stardom. One fine evening, after a difficult performance, she notices someone watching. From then on, Tierra and her team are forced to constantly look around, suspecting they are being secretly videotaped. The aesthetic of a psychological thriller still doesn’t overwhelm the film’s artistic start, and a nugget’s talent guarantees that. Tierra clearly demonstrates with her strongly social incendiary recitatives that there is enough litter on the streets of American cities from which to sprout brilliant poems. The Brazilian “Strange Path” wins many awards in New York – for the best international film, the best screenplay, cinematography and the interpretation of the main role by Carlos Francisco. Aspiring filmmaker David returns to his native Brazil for the first time in 10 years, where he and his film have been invited to a film festival. But due to the outbreak of the pandemic, the festival is canceled and he has to live somewhere for a few days before flying out. David comes to Geraldo (Francisco), his father, whom he has not seen for many years. But he meets his descending son unexpectedly extremely hostile. Tribeca Strange Path Film Festival As festival selector Casey Baron notes, director Guto Parente makes ingenious use of the film’s hero’s experimental footage, layering it across the main narrative to highlight his mood swings and misadventures. romance and horror The smoking tiger motif in Korean culture may indicate the “humanity” of the animal. A Korean-American high school student living in Southern California is the heroine of the contemporary drama “Smoking Tigers”, which received two awards in the Tribeca’s Untold Stories competition – for best actress Chi-Yeon Yoo and for best screenplay in a playwright and directed by Seo Yeon Shelley Yo. The heroine comes from a poor family, but, pushed by her ambitious parents, she is forced to compete with her classmates from elite families obsessed with the idea of ​​entering the best universities. “Smoking Tigers” also received an honorable mention from the Nora Ephron Award jury, an American director and playwright known for her romantic comedies. The award itself went to rookie director Gabriella Moses for Boca Chica, filmed in the Dominican Republic. Desi, 12, sings in the local choir, but her ambitions are much bigger. She left her neighborhood of Boca Chica and found success as a singer in New York. Relations with loved ones back home remain strained, leading to a resounding scandal. “A Night with Adela”. Tribeca Film Festival On the border between “angry” social cinema and naturalistic horror, rookie director Hugo Ruiz wavers in the dark opus One Night With Adela. Ruiz won Best New Feature Film Director. Garbage truck driver Adela is offended by the world, but first by her parents. She is willing to resort to violence, and her plan for revenge is inventive and cruel. The Kenyan ethnographic film “Between the Rains” directed by Andrew Brown and Moses Turanier was named best documentary film. The jury noted the grace and love of the young heroes, inhabitants of a remote African village. Brown is also recognized as the best cinematographer in the category of world documentaries, which firmly adheres to the method of cinema believe. “Between the Rains” Tribeca Film Festival Prizes were also awarded in other categories – short films, audio programs, immersive programs and video games. “We are very proud of the festival’s selection of such a diverse selection of films this year,” festival director Kara Cusumano said in a statement. “Our winners and their films are a strong testament to the vitality of different genres and platforms affirming themselves in the most powerful and inspiring ways.” Laughter as therapy The interest of American documentarians for the dramatic events in Ukraine is perceptible. Special Jury Mention of the Tribeca Documentary Competition awarded to New York filmmaker David Gutnick “Rule of two walls”. (Two Walls Rule). Coming from a family of Ukrainian immigrants, the director traveled to the homeland of his ancestors to show firsthand how the younger generation of artists are resisting barbaric aggression. “War Comedy”. Tribeca Film Festival The challenge of war is eloquently illustrated by the characters of the American documentary Comedy of War: Laughter in Ukraine, directed by Christopher Walters. A group of young stand-up comedians travel through war-torn Ukraine and gather halls full of spectators who, in the words of one of the performers, are ready to laugh not to cry. The images of their performances confirm that humor and laughter are the best therapy against depression and discouragement. Another trip to war-torn Ukraine is captured in Scream of My Blood: A Gogol Bordello Story by American director Nate Pommer, which received a Special Jury Mention for the Albert Maysles Award for Emerging Documentary Director. Charismatic and frenetic leader Eugene Goodz and his legendary rock band, one might say, have become the epitome of muses who cannot be silent in a terrible time of war. The 30-minute short Captains of Ukraine was directed by Matt Danzigo, an American filmmaker and reporter with BBC and NBC experience. The players of the Ukrainian football team are faced with a difficult choice: continue to practice professional sport or take up arms and go to the front? There were no Russian films on the festival program this time around. In the fantasy thriller “ISS”. (ISS), featured in the Spotlight Narrative section, stars two Russian-born actors, Costa Ronin and Masha Mashkova. It was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who is listed in the catalog as a Brazilian-American. Gabriela Cowperthwaite and Masha Mashkova. Photo: Oleg Sulkin Supplies have arrived at the International Space Station, and now here in orbit, three American astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts are on science watch. The status quo is supported by expressions of mutual sympathy, friendship and even love. But the idyll ends when disturbing information arrives from Earth. Something tragic has happened in the world, and the inhabitants of the station stare in horror through the windows at the once blue planet, engulfed in a red glow. Conservatives in Russia and America pass the same secret instruction to “their” envoys in orbit – to gain full control of the station at all costs. The Tribeca Festival was founded in late 2001 by actor Robert De Niro and fellow producers Jane Rosenthal and her husband Craig Hathcoff as the New York creative community’s response to the September 11 attacks. The founders of the festival saw it as a way to revive and diversify the life of the metropolis. Today, the Tribeca Festival has become an integral part of its cultural landscape.

As part of the media day for the home strip for the upcoming campaign, the likes of the Dutchman, the Scotland captain, Ibrahima Konate, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joel Matip and Luis Diaz were tasked with a number of challenges. One of them was trying to get table tennis balls from the end of the table into five cups on the other side. As part of the task, there was points at stake for which cup the ball landed in ranging from 50, all the way down to minus 10. Some of the players opted for different techniques, Matip tried blowing with a straw while defensive partners Konate and others tried varying approaches. In the highlight of the video, the Dutchman turns to Robertson after arching the ball into the cup for 25 points and says: \"Robbo [Robertson], watch this, I'll do it for you\" before arrowing into the 50 points. The Scotland captain was quick to congratulate his defensive partner with Van Dijk adding: \"That's nice, huh?\" After troubles at the start for Robertson, Harvey Elliott and Alexander-Arnold, they all find their groove in a successful streak. It cuts to Matip, a cult-hero amongst fans, as he weaves around the table using the straw finding the cups in seamless fashion. However, it wasn't entirely rosy for all of the Liverpool defenders. For Konate, the pressure and task proved too much as he unleashed his frustration at the game by launching the remaining table tennis balls across the table. While Robertson previously congratulated Van Dijk, he had the last laugh as he was crowned the winner with an impressive haul of 50-point shots.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:00:57","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27146163.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_IMG_3376.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Zimbabwe embraces sports science","link":"https://www.chronicle.co.zw/zimbabwe-embraces-sports-science/","keywords":["Headlines","Sport","Top Stories"],"creator":["Chronicle Editor"],"video_url":null,"description":"Lovemore Dube, lovemore.dube@chronicle.co.zw FORMER Warriors assistant coach Bongani Mafu believes the sports science and technology era has caught with Zimbabwe.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender.

The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order.

Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul.

In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work.

Less than halfway through the president’s term, Walsh was in a comfortable spot in the Cabinet as labor secretary. Then he got a call about an interesting opportunity: running the NHL Players’ Association. The former mayor of Boston and longtime Bruins fan was intrigued and earlier this year accepted the role as executive director. Now three months in, Walsh is trying to get to know players and what they care about most, learning about everything from the Arizona Coyotes’ arena situation to the salary cap and future international competition. “This job is more like being the mayor,” Walsh said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press during the Stanley Cup Final in Las Vegas. “You wake up in the morning, you’re planning on a smooth day and there’s an issue that pops, and that’s the issue of the moment. And then when that issue’s over, there’s another issue that comes right behind it. And if there’s a celebration on anything, that celebration’s short-lived because you’re on to the next issue.” With the current collective bargaining agreement in place through the 2025-26 season, the most pressing issue concerns the Coyotes, set to go into a second season in a 5,000-seat rink on Arizona State’s campus after a referendum for a new arena in Tempe failed. Walsh has met more with Arizona’s players than anyone else among the nearly 200 members he has spoken to so far. “These are National Hockey League players playing in a college arena,” Walsh said. “Players that are heading into the prime of their career now playing in this arena for a couple seasons — it’s just not right. It’s not good for the game.” When Walsh speaks to players, he finds out what they think is good or not so good for the game. Many, like Connor McDavid, prioritize returning to the Olympics after a lengthy absence and getting a World Cup of Hockey on the schedule, while others are more concerned with the cap going up and keeping escrow payments down. Several months after helping the U.S. avert a nationwide rail strike, this job hearkens back to the days when Walsh was president of the Laborers’ Union Local 223 in Massachusetts. With players aged 18-38 in various stages of their careers, he said the NHLPA membership is diverse in what it cares about, just like any other workplace. “One thing I’ve learned quickly is that this truly is a union because every player has a different concern,” Walsh said. “And I think it’s important for me to get to know the membership so I can represent them the best I can, understanding the challenges they have.” Walsh, 56, also has gotten to know Commissioner Gary Bettman since taking over in March. They attended an event together at the Canadian Embassy in Washington in April and have met several times to discuss the cap, the Coyotes and more. “To me, the vital signs seem good,” Bettman told the AP recently. “We’re getting better acquainted. I like him. I respect him. I think he’s smart. I think he’s going to be good for the players, and I look forward to working with him.” Walsh called it a “very cordial working relationship,” while acknowledging there will be disagreements ahead “that put us on two different sides of a fence — and we will have to deal with that when the time comes.” Collective bargaining talks in the coming years almost certainly will bring that conflict. Kevin Shattenkirk, a veteran defenseman who was on the search committee, said Walsh was engaging and commanding right away and gave out his cellphone number to players to call any time after his first interview. “Part of his pitch was that he was going to be readily available to players at any moment — any time that we needed him,” Shattenkirk said Sunday. “With his experience in working in labor unions, I think he knows how important that is. It’s important for the head of it to be accessible and also at the same time to be strong and powerful and know which way he’s leading his organization.” For now, Walsh is trying to lead the way in preparing players for life after hockey and growing the game beyond the nearly $6 billion in revenue. He watches football, basketball and baseball differently since shifting from politics to sports, thinking about what other leagues have done and how it might apply to the NHL. Walsh is a fan of increasing interest in Sweden and other places in Europe with games there and wonders about opportunities for hockey in Latin American countries and among underserved populations in North America. “We have teams like the Dallas Stars and the Coyotes and even the (Florida) Panthers to some degree: large Latino populations,” Walsh said. “You think of Boston — are we tapping into Latino population in Boston, New York, Chicago, places like that?” Just getting a chance to tackle tasks like that excites Walsh, who said he still has a very strong, close friendship with Joe Biden. The president, when Walsh left in February, called him “one tough union chief” and a model for future labor secretaries. This is just a different challenge, one that Walsh feels his entire career has prepared him for. “There’s not many opportunities that probably could have come on my plate that I would’ve been like, ’Oh, this is perfect,’” he said. “This is kind of my whole life coming full circle: labor movement, running a union, opportunities to grow the game, to be progressive in thinking as to how do we grow the game, how do we strengthen the union.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

More than 200 features, shorts, animated, experimental and immersive programs have screened at Tribeca, New York’s largest film festival, held annually in Lower Manhattan since 2002. The festival took place in two dimensions. The first was traditionally represented by public screenings in several cinemas with the presence of the creators of the strips, who answered questions from the public after the screenings. The second, related to the pandemic, invited fans to stream on their computers, tablets and iPhones. For the first time on such a scale, Tribeca has opened up the opportunity for “couch” viewing fans to get acquainted with the show’s schedule, of course, for a fee. The other side of glory “Cipher” won Best American Narrative Film, and the award went to director Chris Moukarbel, who isn’t new to the theme song. He has already made several music videos. Her first feature-length documentary, Me @ The Zoo, premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Cipher, his acting debut, starred 27-year-old Tierra Wack. She first rose to prominence at the age of 15, when she stood on the streets in Philadelphia and sang rap verses for a YouTube channel with unusual expressiveness. Tierra Wack Cipher Star. Credit: AP Today, Wack is a celebrity in the latest hip-hop music subculture. She is admired by celebrities such as Erika Badu and Billie Eilish. But, as Moukarbel’s camera testifies, there is a downside to stardom. One fine evening, after a difficult performance, she notices someone watching. From then on, Tierra and her team are forced to constantly look around, suspecting they are being secretly videotaped. The aesthetic of a psychological thriller still doesn’t overwhelm the film’s artistic start, and a nugget’s talent guarantees that. Tierra clearly demonstrates with her strongly social incendiary recitatives that there is enough litter on the streets of American cities from which to sprout brilliant poems. The Brazilian “Strange Path” wins many awards in New York – for the best international film, the best screenplay, cinematography and the interpretation of the main role by Carlos Francisco. Aspiring filmmaker David returns to his native Brazil for the first time in 10 years, where he and his film have been invited to a film festival. But due to the outbreak of the pandemic, the festival is canceled and he has to live somewhere for a few days before flying out. David comes to Geraldo (Francisco), his father, whom he has not seen for many years. But he meets his descending son unexpectedly extremely hostile. Tribeca Strange Path Film Festival As festival selector Casey Baron notes, director Guto Parente makes ingenious use of the film’s hero’s experimental footage, layering it across the main narrative to highlight his mood swings and misadventures. romance and horror The smoking tiger motif in Korean culture may indicate the “humanity” of the animal. A Korean-American high school student living in Southern California is the heroine of the contemporary drama “Smoking Tigers”, which received two awards in the Tribeca’s Untold Stories competition – for best actress Chi-Yeon Yoo and for best screenplay in a playwright and directed by Seo Yeon Shelley Yo. The heroine comes from a poor family, but, pushed by her ambitious parents, she is forced to compete with her classmates from elite families obsessed with the idea of ​​entering the best universities. “Smoking Tigers” also received an honorable mention from the Nora Ephron Award jury, an American director and playwright known for her romantic comedies. The award itself went to rookie director Gabriella Moses for Boca Chica, filmed in the Dominican Republic. Desi, 12, sings in the local choir, but her ambitions are much bigger. She left her neighborhood of Boca Chica and found success as a singer in New York. Relations with loved ones back home remain strained, leading to a resounding scandal. “A Night with Adela”. Tribeca Film Festival On the border between “angry” social cinema and naturalistic horror, rookie director Hugo Ruiz wavers in the dark opus One Night With Adela. Ruiz won Best New Feature Film Director. Garbage truck driver Adela is offended by the world, but first by her parents. She is willing to resort to violence, and her plan for revenge is inventive and cruel. The Kenyan ethnographic film “Between the Rains” directed by Andrew Brown and Moses Turanier was named best documentary film. The jury noted the grace and love of the young heroes, inhabitants of a remote African village. Brown is also recognized as the best cinematographer in the category of world documentaries, which firmly adheres to the method of cinema believe. “Between the Rains” Tribeca Film Festival Prizes were also awarded in other categories – short films, audio programs, immersive programs and video games. “We are very proud of the festival’s selection of such a diverse selection of films this year,” festival director Kara Cusumano said in a statement. “Our winners and their films are a strong testament to the vitality of different genres and platforms affirming themselves in the most powerful and inspiring ways.” Laughter as therapy The interest of American documentarians for the dramatic events in Ukraine is perceptible. Special Jury Mention of the Tribeca Documentary Competition awarded to New York filmmaker David Gutnick “Rule of two walls”. (Two Walls Rule). Coming from a family of Ukrainian immigrants, the director traveled to the homeland of his ancestors to show firsthand how the younger generation of artists are resisting barbaric aggression. “War Comedy”. Tribeca Film Festival The challenge of war is eloquently illustrated by the characters of the American documentary Comedy of War: Laughter in Ukraine, directed by Christopher Walters. A group of young stand-up comedians travel through war-torn Ukraine and gather halls full of spectators who, in the words of one of the performers, are ready to laugh not to cry. The images of their performances confirm that humor and laughter are the best therapy against depression and discouragement. Another trip to war-torn Ukraine is captured in Scream of My Blood: A Gogol Bordello Story by American director Nate Pommer, which received a Special Jury Mention for the Albert Maysles Award for Emerging Documentary Director. Charismatic and frenetic leader Eugene Goodz and his legendary rock band, one might say, have become the epitome of muses who cannot be silent in a terrible time of war. The 30-minute short Captains of Ukraine was directed by Matt Danzigo, an American filmmaker and reporter with BBC and NBC experience. The players of the Ukrainian football team are faced with a difficult choice: continue to practice professional sport or take up arms and go to the front? There were no Russian films on the festival program this time around. In the fantasy thriller “ISS”. (ISS), featured in the Spotlight Narrative section, stars two Russian-born actors, Costa Ronin and Masha Mashkova. It was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who is listed in the catalog as a Brazilian-American. Gabriela Cowperthwaite and Masha Mashkova. Photo: Oleg Sulkin Supplies have arrived at the International Space Station, and now here in orbit, three American astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts are on science watch. The status quo is supported by expressions of mutual sympathy, friendship and even love. But the idyll ends when disturbing information arrives from Earth. Something tragic has happened in the world, and the inhabitants of the station stare in horror through the windows at the once blue planet, engulfed in a red glow. Conservatives in Russia and America pass the same secret instruction to “their” envoys in orbit – to gain full control of the station at all costs. The Tribeca Festival was founded in late 2001 by actor Robert De Niro and fellow producers Jane Rosenthal and her husband Craig Hathcoff as the New York creative community’s response to the September 11 attacks. The founders of the festival saw it as a way to revive and diversify the life of the metropolis. Today, the Tribeca Festival has become an integral part of its cultural landscape.

Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three. It was another disappointing game for Van Dijk as he rounded off his 2023-24 season with a defeat, the pair will not join up with their teammates for international duty until September.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 17:04:51","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26724153.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_rafjpeg.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton want to sign England int'l for free amid Friday Arsenal news - report","link":"https://www.goodisonnews.com/2023/06/18/everton-transfer-news-ainsley-maitland-niles-targeted-after-confirmed-arsenal-exit/","keywords":["News","Players","Transfers","Ainsley Maitland-Niles","Arsenal","everton"],"creator":["George Overhill"],"video_url":null,"description":"Everton are targeting Ainsley Maitland-Niles again after the England international’s exit from Arsenal, according to Football Transfers.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration.

In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people.

Less than halfway through the president’s term, Walsh was in a comfortable spot in the Cabinet as labor secretary. Then he got a call about an interesting opportunity: running the NHL Players’ Association. The former mayor of Boston and longtime Bruins fan was intrigued and earlier this year accepted the role as executive director. Now three months in, Walsh is trying to get to know players and what they care about most, learning about everything from the Arizona Coyotes’ arena situation to the salary cap and future international competition. “This job is more like being the mayor,” Walsh said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press during the Stanley Cup Final in Las Vegas. “You wake up in the morning, you’re planning on a smooth day and there’s an issue that pops, and that’s the issue of the moment. And then when that issue’s over, there’s another issue that comes right behind it. And if there’s a celebration on anything, that celebration’s short-lived because you’re on to the next issue.” With the current collective bargaining agreement in place through the 2025-26 season, the most pressing issue concerns the Coyotes, set to go into a second season in a 5,000-seat rink on Arizona State’s campus after a referendum for a new arena in Tempe failed. Walsh has met more with Arizona’s players than anyone else among the nearly 200 members he has spoken to so far. “These are National Hockey League players playing in a college arena,” Walsh said. “Players that are heading into the prime of their career now playing in this arena for a couple seasons — it’s just not right. It’s not good for the game.” When Walsh speaks to players, he finds out what they think is good or not so good for the game. Many, like Connor McDavid, prioritize returning to the Olympics after a lengthy absence and getting a World Cup of Hockey on the schedule, while others are more concerned with the cap going up and keeping escrow payments down. Several months after helping the U.S. avert a nationwide rail strike, this job hearkens back to the days when Walsh was president of the Laborers’ Union Local 223 in Massachusetts. With players aged 18-38 in various stages of their careers, he said the NHLPA membership is diverse in what it cares about, just like any other workplace. “One thing I’ve learned quickly is that this truly is a union because every player has a different concern,” Walsh said. “And I think it’s important for me to get to know the membership so I can represent them the best I can, understanding the challenges they have.” Walsh, 56, also has gotten to know Commissioner Gary Bettman since taking over in March. They attended an event together at the Canadian Embassy in Washington in April and have met several times to discuss the cap, the Coyotes and more. “To me, the vital signs seem good,” Bettman told the AP recently. “We’re getting better acquainted. I like him. I respect him. I think he’s smart. I think he’s going to be good for the players, and I look forward to working with him.” Walsh called it a “very cordial working relationship,” while acknowledging there will be disagreements ahead “that put us on two different sides of a fence — and we will have to deal with that when the time comes.” Collective bargaining talks in the coming years almost certainly will bring that conflict. Kevin Shattenkirk, a veteran defenseman who was on the search committee, said Walsh was engaging and commanding right away and gave out his cellphone number to players to call any time after his first interview. “Part of his pitch was that he was going to be readily available to players at any moment — any time that we needed him,” Shattenkirk said Sunday. “With his experience in working in labor unions, I think he knows how important that is. It’s important for the head of it to be accessible and also at the same time to be strong and powerful and know which way he’s leading his organization.” For now, Walsh is trying to lead the way in preparing players for life after hockey and growing the game beyond the nearly $6 billion in revenue. He watches football, basketball and baseball differently since shifting from politics to sports, thinking about what other leagues have done and how it might apply to the NHL. Walsh is a fan of increasing interest in Sweden and other places in Europe with games there and wonders about opportunities for hockey in Latin American countries and among underserved populations in North America. “We have teams like the Dallas Stars and the Coyotes and even the (Florida) Panthers to some degree: large Latino populations,” Walsh said. “You think of Boston — are we tapping into Latino population in Boston, New York, Chicago, places like that?” Just getting a chance to tackle tasks like that excites Walsh, who said he still has a very strong, close friendship with Joe Biden. The president, when Walsh left in February, called him “one tough union chief” and a model for future labor secretaries. This is just a different challenge, one that Walsh feels his entire career has prepared him for. “There’s not many opportunities that probably could have come on my plate that I would’ve been like, ’Oh, this is perfect,’” he said. “This is kind of my whole life coming full circle: labor movement, running a union, opportunities to grow the game, to be progressive in thinking as to how do we grow the game, how do we strengthen the union.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

More than 200 features, shorts, animated, experimental and immersive programs have screened at Tribeca, New York’s largest film festival, held annually in Lower Manhattan since 2002. The festival took place in two dimensions. The first was traditionally represented by public screenings in several cinemas with the presence of the creators of the strips, who answered questions from the public after the screenings. The second, related to the pandemic, invited fans to stream on their computers, tablets and iPhones. For the first time on such a scale, Tribeca has opened up the opportunity for “couch” viewing fans to get acquainted with the show’s schedule, of course, for a fee. The other side of glory “Cipher” won Best American Narrative Film, and the award went to director Chris Moukarbel, who isn’t new to the theme song. He has already made several music videos. Her first feature-length documentary, Me @ The Zoo, premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Cipher, his acting debut, starred 27-year-old Tierra Wack. She first rose to prominence at the age of 15, when she stood on the streets in Philadelphia and sang rap verses for a YouTube channel with unusual expressiveness. Tierra Wack Cipher Star. Credit: AP Today, Wack is a celebrity in the latest hip-hop music subculture. She is admired by celebrities such as Erika Badu and Billie Eilish. But, as Moukarbel’s camera testifies, there is a downside to stardom. One fine evening, after a difficult performance, she notices someone watching. From then on, Tierra and her team are forced to constantly look around, suspecting they are being secretly videotaped. The aesthetic of a psychological thriller still doesn’t overwhelm the film’s artistic start, and a nugget’s talent guarantees that. Tierra clearly demonstrates with her strongly social incendiary recitatives that there is enough litter on the streets of American cities from which to sprout brilliant poems. The Brazilian “Strange Path” wins many awards in New York – for the best international film, the best screenplay, cinematography and the interpretation of the main role by Carlos Francisco. Aspiring filmmaker David returns to his native Brazil for the first time in 10 years, where he and his film have been invited to a film festival. But due to the outbreak of the pandemic, the festival is canceled and he has to live somewhere for a few days before flying out. David comes to Geraldo (Francisco), his father, whom he has not seen for many years. But he meets his descending son unexpectedly extremely hostile. Tribeca Strange Path Film Festival As festival selector Casey Baron notes, director Guto Parente makes ingenious use of the film’s hero’s experimental footage, layering it across the main narrative to highlight his mood swings and misadventures. romance and horror The smoking tiger motif in Korean culture may indicate the “humanity” of the animal. A Korean-American high school student living in Southern California is the heroine of the contemporary drama “Smoking Tigers”, which received two awards in the Tribeca’s Untold Stories competition – for best actress Chi-Yeon Yoo and for best screenplay in a playwright and directed by Seo Yeon Shelley Yo. The heroine comes from a poor family, but, pushed by her ambitious parents, she is forced to compete with her classmates from elite families obsessed with the idea of ​​entering the best universities. “Smoking Tigers” also received an honorable mention from the Nora Ephron Award jury, an American director and playwright known for her romantic comedies. The award itself went to rookie director Gabriella Moses for Boca Chica, filmed in the Dominican Republic. Desi, 12, sings in the local choir, but her ambitions are much bigger. She left her neighborhood of Boca Chica and found success as a singer in New York. Relations with loved ones back home remain strained, leading to a resounding scandal. “A Night with Adela”. Tribeca Film Festival On the border between “angry” social cinema and naturalistic horror, rookie director Hugo Ruiz wavers in the dark opus One Night With Adela. Ruiz won Best New Feature Film Director. Garbage truck driver Adela is offended by the world, but first by her parents. She is willing to resort to violence, and her plan for revenge is inventive and cruel. The Kenyan ethnographic film “Between the Rains” directed by Andrew Brown and Moses Turanier was named best documentary film. The jury noted the grace and love of the young heroes, inhabitants of a remote African village. Brown is also recognized as the best cinematographer in the category of world documentaries, which firmly adheres to the method of cinema believe. “Between the Rains” Tribeca Film Festival Prizes were also awarded in other categories – short films, audio programs, immersive programs and video games. “We are very proud of the festival’s selection of such a diverse selection of films this year,” festival director Kara Cusumano said in a statement. “Our winners and their films are a strong testament to the vitality of different genres and platforms affirming themselves in the most powerful and inspiring ways.” Laughter as therapy The interest of American documentarians for the dramatic events in Ukraine is perceptible. Special Jury Mention of the Tribeca Documentary Competition awarded to New York filmmaker David Gutnick “Rule of two walls”. (Two Walls Rule). Coming from a family of Ukrainian immigrants, the director traveled to the homeland of his ancestors to show firsthand how the younger generation of artists are resisting barbaric aggression. “War Comedy”. Tribeca Film Festival The challenge of war is eloquently illustrated by the characters of the American documentary Comedy of War: Laughter in Ukraine, directed by Christopher Walters. A group of young stand-up comedians travel through war-torn Ukraine and gather halls full of spectators who, in the words of one of the performers, are ready to laugh not to cry. The images of their performances confirm that humor and laughter are the best therapy against depression and discouragement. Another trip to war-torn Ukraine is captured in Scream of My Blood: A Gogol Bordello Story by American director Nate Pommer, which received a Special Jury Mention for the Albert Maysles Award for Emerging Documentary Director. Charismatic and frenetic leader Eugene Goodz and his legendary rock band, one might say, have become the epitome of muses who cannot be silent in a terrible time of war. The 30-minute short Captains of Ukraine was directed by Matt Danzigo, an American filmmaker and reporter with BBC and NBC experience. The players of the Ukrainian football team are faced with a difficult choice: continue to practice professional sport or take up arms and go to the front? There were no Russian films on the festival program this time around. In the fantasy thriller “ISS”. (ISS), featured in the Spotlight Narrative section, stars two Russian-born actors, Costa Ronin and Masha Mashkova. It was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who is listed in the catalog as a Brazilian-American. Gabriela Cowperthwaite and Masha Mashkova. Photo: Oleg Sulkin Supplies have arrived at the International Space Station, and now here in orbit, three American astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts are on science watch. The status quo is supported by expressions of mutual sympathy, friendship and even love. But the idyll ends when disturbing information arrives from Earth. Something tragic has happened in the world, and the inhabitants of the station stare in horror through the windows at the once blue planet, engulfed in a red glow. Conservatives in Russia and America pass the same secret instruction to “their” envoys in orbit – to gain full control of the station at all costs. The Tribeca Festival was founded in late 2001 by actor Robert De Niro and fellow producers Jane Rosenthal and her husband Craig Hathcoff as the New York creative community’s response to the September 11 attacks. The founders of the festival saw it as a way to revive and diversify the life of the metropolis. Today, the Tribeca Festival has become an integral part of its cultural landscape.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul.

In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work.

Less than halfway through the president’s term, Walsh was in a comfortable spot in the Cabinet as labor secretary. Then he got a call about an interesting opportunity: running the NHL Players’ Association. The former mayor of Boston and longtime Bruins fan was intrigued and earlier this year accepted the role as executive director. Now three months in, Walsh is trying to get to know players and what they care about most, learning about everything from the Arizona Coyotes’ arena situation to the salary cap and future international competition. “This job is more like being the mayor,” Walsh said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press during the Stanley Cup Final in Las Vegas. “You wake up in the morning, you’re planning on a smooth day and there’s an issue that pops, and that’s the issue of the moment. And then when that issue’s over, there’s another issue that comes right behind it. And if there’s a celebration on anything, that celebration’s short-lived because you’re on to the next issue.” With the current collective bargaining agreement in place through the 2025-26 season, the most pressing issue concerns the Coyotes, set to go into a second season in a 5,000-seat rink on Arizona State’s campus after a referendum for a new arena in Tempe failed. Walsh has met more with Arizona’s players than anyone else among the nearly 200 members he has spoken to so far. “These are National Hockey League players playing in a college arena,” Walsh said. “Players that are heading into the prime of their career now playing in this arena for a couple seasons — it’s just not right. It’s not good for the game.” When Walsh speaks to players, he finds out what they think is good or not so good for the game. Many, like Connor McDavid, prioritize returning to the Olympics after a lengthy absence and getting a World Cup of Hockey on the schedule, while others are more concerned with the cap going up and keeping escrow payments down. Several months after helping the U.S. avert a nationwide rail strike, this job hearkens back to the days when Walsh was president of the Laborers’ Union Local 223 in Massachusetts. With players aged 18-38 in various stages of their careers, he said the NHLPA membership is diverse in what it cares about, just like any other workplace. “One thing I’ve learned quickly is that this truly is a union because every player has a different concern,” Walsh said. “And I think it’s important for me to get to know the membership so I can represent them the best I can, understanding the challenges they have.” Walsh, 56, also has gotten to know Commissioner Gary Bettman since taking over in March. They attended an event together at the Canadian Embassy in Washington in April and have met several times to discuss the cap, the Coyotes and more. “To me, the vital signs seem good,” Bettman told the AP recently. “We’re getting better acquainted. I like him. I respect him. I think he’s smart. I think he’s going to be good for the players, and I look forward to working with him.” Walsh called it a “very cordial working relationship,” while acknowledging there will be disagreements ahead “that put us on two different sides of a fence — and we will have to deal with that when the time comes.” Collective bargaining talks in the coming years almost certainly will bring that conflict. Kevin Shattenkirk, a veteran defenseman who was on the search committee, said Walsh was engaging and commanding right away and gave out his cellphone number to players to call any time after his first interview. “Part of his pitch was that he was going to be readily available to players at any moment — any time that we needed him,” Shattenkirk said Sunday. “With his experience in working in labor unions, I think he knows how important that is. It’s important for the head of it to be accessible and also at the same time to be strong and powerful and know which way he’s leading his organization.” For now, Walsh is trying to lead the way in preparing players for life after hockey and growing the game beyond the nearly $6 billion in revenue. He watches football, basketball and baseball differently since shifting from politics to sports, thinking about what other leagues have done and how it might apply to the NHL. Walsh is a fan of increasing interest in Sweden and other places in Europe with games there and wonders about opportunities for hockey in Latin American countries and among underserved populations in North America. “We have teams like the Dallas Stars and the Coyotes and even the (Florida) Panthers to some degree: large Latino populations,” Walsh said. “You think of Boston — are we tapping into Latino population in Boston, New York, Chicago, places like that?” Just getting a chance to tackle tasks like that excites Walsh, who said he still has a very strong, close friendship with Joe Biden. The president, when Walsh left in February, called him “one tough union chief” and a model for future labor secretaries. This is just a different challenge, one that Walsh feels his entire career has prepared him for. “There’s not many opportunities that probably could have come on my plate that I would’ve been like, ’Oh, this is perfect,’” he said. “This is kind of my whole life coming full circle: labor movement, running a union, opportunities to grow the game, to be progressive in thinking as to how do we grow the game, how do we strengthen the union.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

More than 200 features, shorts, animated, experimental and immersive programs have screened at Tribeca, New York’s largest film festival, held annually in Lower Manhattan since 2002. The festival took place in two dimensions. The first was traditionally represented by public screenings in several cinemas with the presence of the creators of the strips, who answered questions from the public after the screenings. The second, related to the pandemic, invited fans to stream on their computers, tablets and iPhones. For the first time on such a scale, Tribeca has opened up the opportunity for “couch” viewing fans to get acquainted with the show’s schedule, of course, for a fee. The other side of glory “Cipher” won Best American Narrative Film, and the award went to director Chris Moukarbel, who isn’t new to the theme song. He has already made several music videos. Her first feature-length documentary, Me @ The Zoo, premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Cipher, his acting debut, starred 27-year-old Tierra Wack. She first rose to prominence at the age of 15, when she stood on the streets in Philadelphia and sang rap verses for a YouTube channel with unusual expressiveness. Tierra Wack Cipher Star. Credit: AP Today, Wack is a celebrity in the latest hip-hop music subculture. She is admired by celebrities such as Erika Badu and Billie Eilish. But, as Moukarbel’s camera testifies, there is a downside to stardom. One fine evening, after a difficult performance, she notices someone watching. From then on, Tierra and her team are forced to constantly look around, suspecting they are being secretly videotaped. The aesthetic of a psychological thriller still doesn’t overwhelm the film’s artistic start, and a nugget’s talent guarantees that. Tierra clearly demonstrates with her strongly social incendiary recitatives that there is enough litter on the streets of American cities from which to sprout brilliant poems. The Brazilian “Strange Path” wins many awards in New York – for the best international film, the best screenplay, cinematography and the interpretation of the main role by Carlos Francisco. Aspiring filmmaker David returns to his native Brazil for the first time in 10 years, where he and his film have been invited to a film festival. But due to the outbreak of the pandemic, the festival is canceled and he has to live somewhere for a few days before flying out. David comes to Geraldo (Francisco), his father, whom he has not seen for many years. But he meets his descending son unexpectedly extremely hostile. Tribeca Strange Path Film Festival As festival selector Casey Baron notes, director Guto Parente makes ingenious use of the film’s hero’s experimental footage, layering it across the main narrative to highlight his mood swings and misadventures. romance and horror The smoking tiger motif in Korean culture may indicate the “humanity” of the animal. A Korean-American high school student living in Southern California is the heroine of the contemporary drama “Smoking Tigers”, which received two awards in the Tribeca’s Untold Stories competition – for best actress Chi-Yeon Yoo and for best screenplay in a playwright and directed by Seo Yeon Shelley Yo. The heroine comes from a poor family, but, pushed by her ambitious parents, she is forced to compete with her classmates from elite families obsessed with the idea of ​​entering the best universities. “Smoking Tigers” also received an honorable mention from the Nora Ephron Award jury, an American director and playwright known for her romantic comedies. The award itself went to rookie director Gabriella Moses for Boca Chica, filmed in the Dominican Republic. Desi, 12, sings in the local choir, but her ambitions are much bigger. She left her neighborhood of Boca Chica and found success as a singer in New York. Relations with loved ones back home remain strained, leading to a resounding scandal. “A Night with Adela”. Tribeca Film Festival On the border between “angry” social cinema and naturalistic horror, rookie director Hugo Ruiz wavers in the dark opus One Night With Adela. Ruiz won Best New Feature Film Director. Garbage truck driver Adela is offended by the world, but first by her parents. She is willing to resort to violence, and her plan for revenge is inventive and cruel. The Kenyan ethnographic film “Between the Rains” directed by Andrew Brown and Moses Turanier was named best documentary film. The jury noted the grace and love of the young heroes, inhabitants of a remote African village. Brown is also recognized as the best cinematographer in the category of world documentaries, which firmly adheres to the method of cinema believe. “Between the Rains” Tribeca Film Festival Prizes were also awarded in other categories – short films, audio programs, immersive programs and video games. “We are very proud of the festival’s selection of such a diverse selection of films this year,” festival director Kara Cusumano said in a statement. “Our winners and their films are a strong testament to the vitality of different genres and platforms affirming themselves in the most powerful and inspiring ways.” Laughter as therapy The interest of American documentarians for the dramatic events in Ukraine is perceptible. Special Jury Mention of the Tribeca Documentary Competition awarded to New York filmmaker David Gutnick “Rule of two walls”. (Two Walls Rule). Coming from a family of Ukrainian immigrants, the director traveled to the homeland of his ancestors to show firsthand how the younger generation of artists are resisting barbaric aggression. “War Comedy”. Tribeca Film Festival The challenge of war is eloquently illustrated by the characters of the American documentary Comedy of War: Laughter in Ukraine, directed by Christopher Walters. A group of young stand-up comedians travel through war-torn Ukraine and gather halls full of spectators who, in the words of one of the performers, are ready to laugh not to cry. The images of their performances confirm that humor and laughter are the best therapy against depression and discouragement. Another trip to war-torn Ukraine is captured in Scream of My Blood: A Gogol Bordello Story by American director Nate Pommer, which received a Special Jury Mention for the Albert Maysles Award for Emerging Documentary Director. Charismatic and frenetic leader Eugene Goodz and his legendary rock band, one might say, have become the epitome of muses who cannot be silent in a terrible time of war. The 30-minute short Captains of Ukraine was directed by Matt Danzigo, an American filmmaker and reporter with BBC and NBC experience. The players of the Ukrainian football team are faced with a difficult choice: continue to practice professional sport or take up arms and go to the front? There were no Russian films on the festival program this time around. In the fantasy thriller “ISS”. (ISS), featured in the Spotlight Narrative section, stars two Russian-born actors, Costa Ronin and Masha Mashkova. It was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who is listed in the catalog as a Brazilian-American. Gabriela Cowperthwaite and Masha Mashkova. Photo: Oleg Sulkin Supplies have arrived at the International Space Station, and now here in orbit, three American astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts are on science watch. The status quo is supported by expressions of mutual sympathy, friendship and even love. But the idyll ends when disturbing information arrives from Earth. Something tragic has happened in the world, and the inhabitants of the station stare in horror through the windows at the once blue planet, engulfed in a red glow. Conservatives in Russia and America pass the same secret instruction to “their” envoys in orbit – to gain full control of the station at all costs. The Tribeca Festival was founded in late 2001 by actor Robert De Niro and fellow producers Jane Rosenthal and her husband Craig Hathcoff as the New York creative community’s response to the September 11 attacks. The founders of the festival saw it as a way to revive and diversify the life of the metropolis. Today, the Tribeca Festival has become an integral part of its cultural landscape.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate.

Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

Son, who plays for Shandong Taishan in the Chinese Super League, has been held in Liaoning province since mid-May on what Chinese officials have said are bribery charges. \"The public authorities who have been investigating Son Jun-ho have received approval for his arrest from the prosecution,\" the source said, noting the period of detention expired Saturday. \"The switch to an investigation under arrest means that the public security authorities have begun taking formal legal steps against Son Jun-ho.\" Once an arrest is approved, public security authorities typically take around two months to carry out a deeper investigation before taking steps for an indictment, the source said. \"However, in serious cases, it can take up to several months before the indictment,\" the source said.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three. It was another disappointing game for Van Dijk as he rounded off his 2023-24 season with a defeat, the pair will not join up with their teammates for international duty until September.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 17:04:51","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26724153.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_rafjpeg.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton want to sign England int'l for free amid Friday Arsenal news - report","link":"https://www.goodisonnews.com/2023/06/18/everton-transfer-news-ainsley-maitland-niles-targeted-after-confirmed-arsenal-exit/","keywords":["News","Players","Transfers","Ainsley Maitland-Niles","Arsenal","everton"],"creator":["George Overhill"],"video_url":null,"description":"Everton are targeting Ainsley Maitland-Niles again after the England international’s exit from Arsenal, according to Football Transfers.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul.

In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people.

Less than halfway through the president’s term, Walsh was in a comfortable spot in the Cabinet as labor secretary. Then he got a call about an interesting opportunity: running the NHL Players’ Association. The former mayor of Boston and longtime Bruins fan was intrigued and earlier this year accepted the role as executive director. Now three months in, Walsh is trying to get to know players and what they care about most, learning about everything from the Arizona Coyotes’ arena situation to the salary cap and future international competition. “This job is more like being the mayor,” Walsh said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press during the Stanley Cup Final in Las Vegas. “You wake up in the morning, you’re planning on a smooth day and there’s an issue that pops, and that’s the issue of the moment. And then when that issue’s over, there’s another issue that comes right behind it. And if there’s a celebration on anything, that celebration’s short-lived because you’re on to the next issue.” With the current collective bargaining agreement in place through the 2025-26 season, the most pressing issue concerns the Coyotes, set to go into a second season in a 5,000-seat rink on Arizona State’s campus after a referendum for a new arena in Tempe failed. Walsh has met more with Arizona’s players than anyone else among the nearly 200 members he has spoken to so far. “These are National Hockey League players playing in a college arena,” Walsh said. “Players that are heading into the prime of their career now playing in this arena for a couple seasons — it’s just not right. It’s not good for the game.” When Walsh speaks to players, he finds out what they think is good or not so good for the game. Many, like Connor McDavid, prioritize returning to the Olympics after a lengthy absence and getting a World Cup of Hockey on the schedule, while others are more concerned with the cap going up and keeping escrow payments down. Several months after helping the U.S. avert a nationwide rail strike, this job hearkens back to the days when Walsh was president of the Laborers’ Union Local 223 in Massachusetts. With players aged 18-38 in various stages of their careers, he said the NHLPA membership is diverse in what it cares about, just like any other workplace. “One thing I’ve learned quickly is that this truly is a union because every player has a different concern,” Walsh said. “And I think it’s important for me to get to know the membership so I can represent them the best I can, understanding the challenges they have.” Walsh, 56, also has gotten to know Commissioner Gary Bettman since taking over in March. They attended an event together at the Canadian Embassy in Washington in April and have met several times to discuss the cap, the Coyotes and more. “To me, the vital signs seem good,” Bettman told the AP recently. “We’re getting better acquainted. I like him. I respect him. I think he’s smart. I think he’s going to be good for the players, and I look forward to working with him.” Walsh called it a “very cordial working relationship,” while acknowledging there will be disagreements ahead “that put us on two different sides of a fence — and we will have to deal with that when the time comes.” Collective bargaining talks in the coming years almost certainly will bring that conflict. Kevin Shattenkirk, a veteran defenseman who was on the search committee, said Walsh was engaging and commanding right away and gave out his cellphone number to players to call any time after his first interview. “Part of his pitch was that he was going to be readily available to players at any moment — any time that we needed him,” Shattenkirk said Sunday. “With his experience in working in labor unions, I think he knows how important that is. It’s important for the head of it to be accessible and also at the same time to be strong and powerful and know which way he’s leading his organization.” For now, Walsh is trying to lead the way in preparing players for life after hockey and growing the game beyond the nearly $6 billion in revenue. He watches football, basketball and baseball differently since shifting from politics to sports, thinking about what other leagues have done and how it might apply to the NHL. Walsh is a fan of increasing interest in Sweden and other places in Europe with games there and wonders about opportunities for hockey in Latin American countries and among underserved populations in North America. “We have teams like the Dallas Stars and the Coyotes and even the (Florida) Panthers to some degree: large Latino populations,” Walsh said. “You think of Boston — are we tapping into Latino population in Boston, New York, Chicago, places like that?” Just getting a chance to tackle tasks like that excites Walsh, who said he still has a very strong, close friendship with Joe Biden. The president, when Walsh left in February, called him “one tough union chief” and a model for future labor secretaries. This is just a different challenge, one that Walsh feels his entire career has prepared him for. “There’s not many opportunities that probably could have come on my plate that I would’ve been like, ’Oh, this is perfect,’” he said. “This is kind of my whole life coming full circle: labor movement, running a union, opportunities to grow the game, to be progressive in thinking as to how do we grow the game, how do we strengthen the union.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

More than 200 features, shorts, animated, experimental and immersive programs have screened at Tribeca, New York’s largest film festival, held annually in Lower Manhattan since 2002. The festival took place in two dimensions. The first was traditionally represented by public screenings in several cinemas with the presence of the creators of the strips, who answered questions from the public after the screenings. The second, related to the pandemic, invited fans to stream on their computers, tablets and iPhones. For the first time on such a scale, Tribeca has opened up the opportunity for “couch” viewing fans to get acquainted with the show’s schedule, of course, for a fee. The other side of glory “Cipher” won Best American Narrative Film, and the award went to director Chris Moukarbel, who isn’t new to the theme song. He has already made several music videos. Her first feature-length documentary, Me @ The Zoo, premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Cipher, his acting debut, starred 27-year-old Tierra Wack. She first rose to prominence at the age of 15, when she stood on the streets in Philadelphia and sang rap verses for a YouTube channel with unusual expressiveness. Tierra Wack Cipher Star. Credit: AP Today, Wack is a celebrity in the latest hip-hop music subculture. She is admired by celebrities such as Erika Badu and Billie Eilish. But, as Moukarbel’s camera testifies, there is a downside to stardom. One fine evening, after a difficult performance, she notices someone watching. From then on, Tierra and her team are forced to constantly look around, suspecting they are being secretly videotaped. The aesthetic of a psychological thriller still doesn’t overwhelm the film’s artistic start, and a nugget’s talent guarantees that. Tierra clearly demonstrates with her strongly social incendiary recitatives that there is enough litter on the streets of American cities from which to sprout brilliant poems. The Brazilian “Strange Path” wins many awards in New York – for the best international film, the best screenplay, cinematography and the interpretation of the main role by Carlos Francisco. Aspiring filmmaker David returns to his native Brazil for the first time in 10 years, where he and his film have been invited to a film festival. But due to the outbreak of the pandemic, the festival is canceled and he has to live somewhere for a few days before flying out. David comes to Geraldo (Francisco), his father, whom he has not seen for many years. But he meets his descending son unexpectedly extremely hostile. Tribeca Strange Path Film Festival As festival selector Casey Baron notes, director Guto Parente makes ingenious use of the film’s hero’s experimental footage, layering it across the main narrative to highlight his mood swings and misadventures. romance and horror The smoking tiger motif in Korean culture may indicate the “humanity” of the animal. A Korean-American high school student living in Southern California is the heroine of the contemporary drama “Smoking Tigers”, which received two awards in the Tribeca’s Untold Stories competition – for best actress Chi-Yeon Yoo and for best screenplay in a playwright and directed by Seo Yeon Shelley Yo. The heroine comes from a poor family, but, pushed by her ambitious parents, she is forced to compete with her classmates from elite families obsessed with the idea of ​​entering the best universities. “Smoking Tigers” also received an honorable mention from the Nora Ephron Award jury, an American director and playwright known for her romantic comedies. The award itself went to rookie director Gabriella Moses for Boca Chica, filmed in the Dominican Republic. Desi, 12, sings in the local choir, but her ambitions are much bigger. She left her neighborhood of Boca Chica and found success as a singer in New York. Relations with loved ones back home remain strained, leading to a resounding scandal. “A Night with Adela”. Tribeca Film Festival On the border between “angry” social cinema and naturalistic horror, rookie director Hugo Ruiz wavers in the dark opus One Night With Adela. Ruiz won Best New Feature Film Director. Garbage truck driver Adela is offended by the world, but first by her parents. She is willing to resort to violence, and her plan for revenge is inventive and cruel. The Kenyan ethnographic film “Between the Rains” directed by Andrew Brown and Moses Turanier was named best documentary film. The jury noted the grace and love of the young heroes, inhabitants of a remote African village. Brown is also recognized as the best cinematographer in the category of world documentaries, which firmly adheres to the method of cinema believe. “Between the Rains” Tribeca Film Festival Prizes were also awarded in other categories – short films, audio programs, immersive programs and video games. “We are very proud of the festival’s selection of such a diverse selection of films this year,” festival director Kara Cusumano said in a statement. “Our winners and their films are a strong testament to the vitality of different genres and platforms affirming themselves in the most powerful and inspiring ways.” Laughter as therapy The interest of American documentarians for the dramatic events in Ukraine is perceptible. Special Jury Mention of the Tribeca Documentary Competition awarded to New York filmmaker David Gutnick “Rule of two walls”. (Two Walls Rule). Coming from a family of Ukrainian immigrants, the director traveled to the homeland of his ancestors to show firsthand how the younger generation of artists are resisting barbaric aggression. “War Comedy”. Tribeca Film Festival The challenge of war is eloquently illustrated by the characters of the American documentary Comedy of War: Laughter in Ukraine, directed by Christopher Walters. A group of young stand-up comedians travel through war-torn Ukraine and gather halls full of spectators who, in the words of one of the performers, are ready to laugh not to cry. The images of their performances confirm that humor and laughter are the best therapy against depression and discouragement. Another trip to war-torn Ukraine is captured in Scream of My Blood: A Gogol Bordello Story by American director Nate Pommer, which received a Special Jury Mention for the Albert Maysles Award for Emerging Documentary Director. Charismatic and frenetic leader Eugene Goodz and his legendary rock band, one might say, have become the epitome of muses who cannot be silent in a terrible time of war. The 30-minute short Captains of Ukraine was directed by Matt Danzigo, an American filmmaker and reporter with BBC and NBC experience. The players of the Ukrainian football team are faced with a difficult choice: continue to practice professional sport or take up arms and go to the front? There were no Russian films on the festival program this time around. In the fantasy thriller “ISS”. (ISS), featured in the Spotlight Narrative section, stars two Russian-born actors, Costa Ronin and Masha Mashkova. It was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who is listed in the catalog as a Brazilian-American. Gabriela Cowperthwaite and Masha Mashkova. Photo: Oleg Sulkin Supplies have arrived at the International Space Station, and now here in orbit, three American astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts are on science watch. The status quo is supported by expressions of mutual sympathy, friendship and even love. But the idyll ends when disturbing information arrives from Earth. Something tragic has happened in the world, and the inhabitants of the station stare in horror through the windows at the once blue planet, engulfed in a red glow. Conservatives in Russia and America pass the same secret instruction to “their” envoys in orbit – to gain full control of the station at all costs. The Tribeca Festival was founded in late 2001 by actor Robert De Niro and fellow producers Jane Rosenthal and her husband Craig Hathcoff as the New York creative community’s response to the September 11 attacks. The founders of the festival saw it as a way to revive and diversify the life of the metropolis. Today, the Tribeca Festival has become an integral part of its cultural landscape.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul. Following on from his comments about his \"little brother\", the 24-year-old has added fuel to the fire that is the speculation surrounding his fellow Frenchman. In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work.

Less than halfway through the president’s term, Walsh was in a comfortable spot in the Cabinet as labor secretary. Then he got a call about an interesting opportunity: running the NHL Players’ Association. The former mayor of Boston and longtime Bruins fan was intrigued and earlier this year accepted the role as executive director. Now three months in, Walsh is trying to get to know players and what they care about most, learning about everything from the Arizona Coyotes’ arena situation to the salary cap and future international competition. “This job is more like being the mayor,” Walsh said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press during the Stanley Cup Final in Las Vegas. “You wake up in the morning, you’re planning on a smooth day and there’s an issue that pops, and that’s the issue of the moment. And then when that issue’s over, there’s another issue that comes right behind it. And if there’s a celebration on anything, that celebration’s short-lived because you’re on to the next issue.” With the current collective bargaining agreement in place through the 2025-26 season, the most pressing issue concerns the Coyotes, set to go into a second season in a 5,000-seat rink on Arizona State’s campus after a referendum for a new arena in Tempe failed. Walsh has met more with Arizona’s players than anyone else among the nearly 200 members he has spoken to so far. “These are National Hockey League players playing in a college arena,” Walsh said. “Players that are heading into the prime of their career now playing in this arena for a couple seasons — it’s just not right. It’s not good for the game.” When Walsh speaks to players, he finds out what they think is good or not so good for the game. Many, like Connor McDavid, prioritize returning to the Olympics after a lengthy absence and getting a World Cup of Hockey on the schedule, while others are more concerned with the cap going up and keeping escrow payments down. Several months after helping the U.S. avert a nationwide rail strike, this job hearkens back to the days when Walsh was president of the Laborers’ Union Local 223 in Massachusetts. With players aged 18-38 in various stages of their careers, he said the NHLPA membership is diverse in what it cares about, just like any other workplace. “One thing I’ve learned quickly is that this truly is a union because every player has a different concern,” Walsh said. “And I think it’s important for me to get to know the membership so I can represent them the best I can, understanding the challenges they have.” Walsh, 56, also has gotten to know Commissioner Gary Bettman since taking over in March. They attended an event together at the Canadian Embassy in Washington in April and have met several times to discuss the cap, the Coyotes and more. “To me, the vital signs seem good,” Bettman told the AP recently. “We’re getting better acquainted. I like him. I respect him. I think he’s smart. I think he’s going to be good for the players, and I look forward to working with him.” Walsh called it a “very cordial working relationship,” while acknowledging there will be disagreements ahead “that put us on two different sides of a fence — and we will have to deal with that when the time comes.” Collective bargaining talks in the coming years almost certainly will bring that conflict. Kevin Shattenkirk, a veteran defenseman who was on the search committee, said Walsh was engaging and commanding right away and gave out his cellphone number to players to call any time after his first interview. “Part of his pitch was that he was going to be readily available to players at any moment — any time that we needed him,” Shattenkirk said Sunday. “With his experience in working in labor unions, I think he knows how important that is. It’s important for the head of it to be accessible and also at the same time to be strong and powerful and know which way he’s leading his organization.” For now, Walsh is trying to lead the way in preparing players for life after hockey and growing the game beyond the nearly $6 billion in revenue. He watches football, basketball and baseball differently since shifting from politics to sports, thinking about what other leagues have done and how it might apply to the NHL. Walsh is a fan of increasing interest in Sweden and other places in Europe with games there and wonders about opportunities for hockey in Latin American countries and among underserved populations in North America. “We have teams like the Dallas Stars and the Coyotes and even the (Florida) Panthers to some degree: large Latino populations,” Walsh said. “You think of Boston — are we tapping into Latino population in Boston, New York, Chicago, places like that?” Just getting a chance to tackle tasks like that excites Walsh, who said he still has a very strong, close friendship with Joe Biden. The president, when Walsh left in February, called him “one tough union chief” and a model for future labor secretaries. This is just a different challenge, one that Walsh feels his entire career has prepared him for. “There’s not many opportunities that probably could have come on my plate that I would’ve been like, ’Oh, this is perfect,’” he said. “This is kind of my whole life coming full circle: labor movement, running a union, opportunities to grow the game, to be progressive in thinking as to how do we grow the game, how do we strengthen the union.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

More than 200 features, shorts, animated, experimental and immersive programs have screened at Tribeca, New York’s largest film festival, held annually in Lower Manhattan since 2002. The festival took place in two dimensions. The first was traditionally represented by public screenings in several cinemas with the presence of the creators of the strips, who answered questions from the public after the screenings. The second, related to the pandemic, invited fans to stream on their computers, tablets and iPhones. For the first time on such a scale, Tribeca has opened up the opportunity for “couch” viewing fans to get acquainted with the show’s schedule, of course, for a fee. The other side of glory “Cipher” won Best American Narrative Film, and the award went to director Chris Moukarbel, who isn’t new to the theme song. He has already made several music videos. Her first feature-length documentary, Me @ The Zoo, premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Cipher, his acting debut, starred 27-year-old Tierra Wack. She first rose to prominence at the age of 15, when she stood on the streets in Philadelphia and sang rap verses for a YouTube channel with unusual expressiveness. Tierra Wack Cipher Star. Credit: AP Today, Wack is a celebrity in the latest hip-hop music subculture. She is admired by celebrities such as Erika Badu and Billie Eilish. But, as Moukarbel’s camera testifies, there is a downside to stardom. One fine evening, after a difficult performance, she notices someone watching. From then on, Tierra and her team are forced to constantly look around, suspecting they are being secretly videotaped. The aesthetic of a psychological thriller still doesn’t overwhelm the film’s artistic start, and a nugget’s talent guarantees that. Tierra clearly demonstrates with her strongly social incendiary recitatives that there is enough litter on the streets of American cities from which to sprout brilliant poems. The Brazilian “Strange Path” wins many awards in New York – for the best international film, the best screenplay, cinematography and the interpretation of the main role by Carlos Francisco. Aspiring filmmaker David returns to his native Brazil for the first time in 10 years, where he and his film have been invited to a film festival. But due to the outbreak of the pandemic, the festival is canceled and he has to live somewhere for a few days before flying out. David comes to Geraldo (Francisco), his father, whom he has not seen for many years. But he meets his descending son unexpectedly extremely hostile. Tribeca Strange Path Film Festival As festival selector Casey Baron notes, director Guto Parente makes ingenious use of the film’s hero’s experimental footage, layering it across the main narrative to highlight his mood swings and misadventures. romance and horror The smoking tiger motif in Korean culture may indicate the “humanity” of the animal. A Korean-American high school student living in Southern California is the heroine of the contemporary drama “Smoking Tigers”, which received two awards in the Tribeca’s Untold Stories competition – for best actress Chi-Yeon Yoo and for best screenplay in a playwright and directed by Seo Yeon Shelley Yo. The heroine comes from a poor family, but, pushed by her ambitious parents, she is forced to compete with her classmates from elite families obsessed with the idea of ​​entering the best universities. “Smoking Tigers” also received an honorable mention from the Nora Ephron Award jury, an American director and playwright known for her romantic comedies. The award itself went to rookie director Gabriella Moses for Boca Chica, filmed in the Dominican Republic. Desi, 12, sings in the local choir, but her ambitions are much bigger. She left her neighborhood of Boca Chica and found success as a singer in New York. Relations with loved ones back home remain strained, leading to a resounding scandal. “A Night with Adela”. Tribeca Film Festival On the border between “angry” social cinema and naturalistic horror, rookie director Hugo Ruiz wavers in the dark opus One Night With Adela. Ruiz won Best New Feature Film Director. Garbage truck driver Adela is offended by the world, but first by her parents. She is willing to resort to violence, and her plan for revenge is inventive and cruel. The Kenyan ethnographic film “Between the Rains” directed by Andrew Brown and Moses Turanier was named best documentary film. The jury noted the grace and love of the young heroes, inhabitants of a remote African village. Brown is also recognized as the best cinematographer in the category of world documentaries, which firmly adheres to the method of cinema believe. “Between the Rains” Tribeca Film Festival Prizes were also awarded in other categories – short films, audio programs, immersive programs and video games. “We are very proud of the festival’s selection of such a diverse selection of films this year,” festival director Kara Cusumano said in a statement. “Our winners and their films are a strong testament to the vitality of different genres and platforms affirming themselves in the most powerful and inspiring ways.” Laughter as therapy The interest of American documentarians for the dramatic events in Ukraine is perceptible. Special Jury Mention of the Tribeca Documentary Competition awarded to New York filmmaker David Gutnick “Rule of two walls”. (Two Walls Rule). Coming from a family of Ukrainian immigrants, the director traveled to the homeland of his ancestors to show firsthand how the younger generation of artists are resisting barbaric aggression. “War Comedy”. Tribeca Film Festival The challenge of war is eloquently illustrated by the characters of the American documentary Comedy of War: Laughter in Ukraine, directed by Christopher Walters. A group of young stand-up comedians travel through war-torn Ukraine and gather halls full of spectators who, in the words of one of the performers, are ready to laugh not to cry. The images of their performances confirm that humor and laughter are the best therapy against depression and discouragement. Another trip to war-torn Ukraine is captured in Scream of My Blood: A Gogol Bordello Story by American director Nate Pommer, which received a Special Jury Mention for the Albert Maysles Award for Emerging Documentary Director. Charismatic and frenetic leader Eugene Goodz and his legendary rock band, one might say, have become the epitome of muses who cannot be silent in a terrible time of war. The 30-minute short Captains of Ukraine was directed by Matt Danzigo, an American filmmaker and reporter with BBC and NBC experience. The players of the Ukrainian football team are faced with a difficult choice: continue to practice professional sport or take up arms and go to the front? There were no Russian films on the festival program this time around. In the fantasy thriller “ISS”. (ISS), featured in the Spotlight Narrative section, stars two Russian-born actors, Costa Ronin and Masha Mashkova. It was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who is listed in the catalog as a Brazilian-American. Gabriela Cowperthwaite and Masha Mashkova. Photo: Oleg Sulkin Supplies have arrived at the International Space Station, and now here in orbit, three American astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts are on science watch. The status quo is supported by expressions of mutual sympathy, friendship and even love. But the idyll ends when disturbing information arrives from Earth. Something tragic has happened in the world, and the inhabitants of the station stare in horror through the windows at the once blue planet, engulfed in a red glow. Conservatives in Russia and America pass the same secret instruction to “their” envoys in orbit – to gain full control of the station at all costs. The Tribeca Festival was founded in late 2001 by actor Robert De Niro and fellow producers Jane Rosenthal and her husband Craig Hathcoff as the New York creative community’s response to the September 11 attacks. The founders of the festival saw it as a way to revive and diversify the life of the metropolis. Today, the Tribeca Festival has become an integral part of its cultural landscape.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

Son, who plays for Shandong Taishan in the Chinese Super League, has been held in Liaoning province since mid-May on what Chinese officials have said are bribery charges. \"The public authorities who have been investigating Son Jun-ho have received approval for his arrest from the prosecution,\" the source said, noting the period of detention expired Saturday. \"The switch to an investigation under arrest means that the public security authorities have begun taking formal legal steps against Son Jun-ho.\" Once an arrest is approved, public security authorities typically take around two months to carry out a deeper investigation before taking steps for an indictment, the source said. \"However, in serious cases, it can take up to several months before the indictment,\" the source said.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three. It was another disappointing game for Van Dijk as he rounded off his 2023-24 season with a defeat, the pair will not join up with their teammates for international duty until September.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 17:04:51","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26724153.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_rafjpeg.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton want to sign England int'l for free amid Friday Arsenal news - report","link":"https://www.goodisonnews.com/2023/06/18/everton-transfer-news-ainsley-maitland-niles-targeted-after-confirmed-arsenal-exit/","keywords":["News","Players","Transfers","Ainsley Maitland-Niles","Arsenal","everton"],"creator":["George Overhill"],"video_url":null,"description":"Everton are targeting Ainsley Maitland-Niles again after the England international’s exit from Arsenal, according to Football Transfers.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul.

In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work.

Less than halfway through the president’s term, Walsh was in a comfortable spot in the Cabinet as labor secretary. Then he got a call about an interesting opportunity: running the NHL Players’ Association. The former mayor of Boston and longtime Bruins fan was intrigued and earlier this year accepted the role as executive director. Now three months in, Walsh is trying to get to know players and what they care about most, learning about everything from the Arizona Coyotes’ arena situation to the salary cap and future international competition. “This job is more like being the mayor,” Walsh said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press during the Stanley Cup Final in Las Vegas. “You wake up in the morning, you’re planning on a smooth day and there’s an issue that pops, and that’s the issue of the moment. And then when that issue’s over, there’s another issue that comes right behind it. And if there’s a celebration on anything, that celebration’s short-lived because you’re on to the next issue.” With the current collective bargaining agreement in place through the 2025-26 season, the most pressing issue concerns the Coyotes, set to go into a second season in a 5,000-seat rink on Arizona State’s campus after a referendum for a new arena in Tempe failed. Walsh has met more with Arizona’s players than anyone else among the nearly 200 members he has spoken to so far. “These are National Hockey League players playing in a college arena,” Walsh said. “Players that are heading into the prime of their career now playing in this arena for a couple seasons — it’s just not right. It’s not good for the game.” When Walsh speaks to players, he finds out what they think is good or not so good for the game. Many, like Connor McDavid, prioritize returning to the Olympics after a lengthy absence and getting a World Cup of Hockey on the schedule, while others are more concerned with the cap going up and keeping escrow payments down. Several months after helping the U.S. avert a nationwide rail strike, this job hearkens back to the days when Walsh was president of the Laborers’ Union Local 223 in Massachusetts. With players aged 18-38 in various stages of their careers, he said the NHLPA membership is diverse in what it cares about, just like any other workplace. “One thing I’ve learned quickly is that this truly is a union because every player has a different concern,” Walsh said. “And I think it’s important for me to get to know the membership so I can represent them the best I can, understanding the challenges they have.” Walsh, 56, also has gotten to know Commissioner Gary Bettman since taking over in March. They attended an event together at the Canadian Embassy in Washington in April and have met several times to discuss the cap, the Coyotes and more. “To me, the vital signs seem good,” Bettman told the AP recently. “We’re getting better acquainted. I like him. I respect him. I think he’s smart. I think he’s going to be good for the players, and I look forward to working with him.” Walsh called it a “very cordial working relationship,” while acknowledging there will be disagreements ahead “that put us on two different sides of a fence — and we will have to deal with that when the time comes.” Collective bargaining talks in the coming years almost certainly will bring that conflict. Kevin Shattenkirk, a veteran defenseman who was on the search committee, said Walsh was engaging and commanding right away and gave out his cellphone number to players to call any time after his first interview. “Part of his pitch was that he was going to be readily available to players at any moment — any time that we needed him,” Shattenkirk said Sunday. “With his experience in working in labor unions, I think he knows how important that is. It’s important for the head of it to be accessible and also at the same time to be strong and powerful and know which way he’s leading his organization.” For now, Walsh is trying to lead the way in preparing players for life after hockey and growing the game beyond the nearly $6 billion in revenue. He watches football, basketball and baseball differently since shifting from politics to sports, thinking about what other leagues have done and how it might apply to the NHL. Walsh is a fan of increasing interest in Sweden and other places in Europe with games there and wonders about opportunities for hockey in Latin American countries and among underserved populations in North America. “We have teams like the Dallas Stars and the Coyotes and even the (Florida) Panthers to some degree: large Latino populations,” Walsh said. “You think of Boston — are we tapping into Latino population in Boston, New York, Chicago, places like that?” Just getting a chance to tackle tasks like that excites Walsh, who said he still has a very strong, close friendship with Joe Biden. The president, when Walsh left in February, called him “one tough union chief” and a model for future labor secretaries. This is just a different challenge, one that Walsh feels his entire career has prepared him for. “There’s not many opportunities that probably could have come on my plate that I would’ve been like, ’Oh, this is perfect,’” he said. “This is kind of my whole life coming full circle: labor movement, running a union, opportunities to grow the game, to be progressive in thinking as to how do we grow the game, how do we strengthen the union.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

More than 200 features, shorts, animated, experimental and immersive programs have screened at Tribeca, New York’s largest film festival, held annually in Lower Manhattan since 2002. The festival took place in two dimensions. The first was traditionally represented by public screenings in several cinemas with the presence of the creators of the strips, who answered questions from the public after the screenings. The second, related to the pandemic, invited fans to stream on their computers, tablets and iPhones. For the first time on such a scale, Tribeca has opened up the opportunity for “couch” viewing fans to get acquainted with the show’s schedule, of course, for a fee. The other side of glory “Cipher” won Best American Narrative Film, and the award went to director Chris Moukarbel, who isn’t new to the theme song. He has already made several music videos. Her first feature-length documentary, Me @ The Zoo, premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Cipher, his acting debut, starred 27-year-old Tierra Wack. She first rose to prominence at the age of 15, when she stood on the streets in Philadelphia and sang rap verses for a YouTube channel with unusual expressiveness. Tierra Wack Cipher Star. Credit: AP Today, Wack is a celebrity in the latest hip-hop music subculture. She is admired by celebrities such as Erika Badu and Billie Eilish. But, as Moukarbel’s camera testifies, there is a downside to stardom. One fine evening, after a difficult performance, she notices someone watching. From then on, Tierra and her team are forced to constantly look around, suspecting they are being secretly videotaped. The aesthetic of a psychological thriller still doesn’t overwhelm the film’s artistic start, and a nugget’s talent guarantees that. Tierra clearly demonstrates with her strongly social incendiary recitatives that there is enough litter on the streets of American cities from which to sprout brilliant poems. The Brazilian “Strange Path” wins many awards in New York – for the best international film, the best screenplay, cinematography and the interpretation of the main role by Carlos Francisco. Aspiring filmmaker David returns to his native Brazil for the first time in 10 years, where he and his film have been invited to a film festival. But due to the outbreak of the pandemic, the festival is canceled and he has to live somewhere for a few days before flying out. David comes to Geraldo (Francisco), his father, whom he has not seen for many years. But he meets his descending son unexpectedly extremely hostile. Tribeca Strange Path Film Festival As festival selector Casey Baron notes, director Guto Parente makes ingenious use of the film’s hero’s experimental footage, layering it across the main narrative to highlight his mood swings and misadventures. romance and horror The smoking tiger motif in Korean culture may indicate the “humanity” of the animal. A Korean-American high school student living in Southern California is the heroine of the contemporary drama “Smoking Tigers”, which received two awards in the Tribeca’s Untold Stories competition – for best actress Chi-Yeon Yoo and for best screenplay in a playwright and directed by Seo Yeon Shelley Yo. The heroine comes from a poor family, but, pushed by her ambitious parents, she is forced to compete with her classmates from elite families obsessed with the idea of ​​entering the best universities. “Smoking Tigers” also received an honorable mention from the Nora Ephron Award jury, an American director and playwright known for her romantic comedies. The award itself went to rookie director Gabriella Moses for Boca Chica, filmed in the Dominican Republic. Desi, 12, sings in the local choir, but her ambitions are much bigger. She left her neighborhood of Boca Chica and found success as a singer in New York. Relations with loved ones back home remain strained, leading to a resounding scandal. “A Night with Adela”. Tribeca Film Festival On the border between “angry” social cinema and naturalistic horror, rookie director Hugo Ruiz wavers in the dark opus One Night With Adela. Ruiz won Best New Feature Film Director. Garbage truck driver Adela is offended by the world, but first by her parents. She is willing to resort to violence, and her plan for revenge is inventive and cruel. The Kenyan ethnographic film “Between the Rains” directed by Andrew Brown and Moses Turanier was named best documentary film. The jury noted the grace and love of the young heroes, inhabitants of a remote African village. Brown is also recognized as the best cinematographer in the category of world documentaries, which firmly adheres to the method of cinema believe. “Between the Rains” Tribeca Film Festival Prizes were also awarded in other categories – short films, audio programs, immersive programs and video games. “We are very proud of the festival’s selection of such a diverse selection of films this year,” festival director Kara Cusumano said in a statement. “Our winners and their films are a strong testament to the vitality of different genres and platforms affirming themselves in the most powerful and inspiring ways.” Laughter as therapy The interest of American documentarians for the dramatic events in Ukraine is perceptible. Special Jury Mention of the Tribeca Documentary Competition awarded to New York filmmaker David Gutnick “Rule of two walls”. (Two Walls Rule). Coming from a family of Ukrainian immigrants, the director traveled to the homeland of his ancestors to show firsthand how the younger generation of artists are resisting barbaric aggression. “War Comedy”. Tribeca Film Festival The challenge of war is eloquently illustrated by the characters of the American documentary Comedy of War: Laughter in Ukraine, directed by Christopher Walters. A group of young stand-up comedians travel through war-torn Ukraine and gather halls full of spectators who, in the words of one of the performers, are ready to laugh not to cry. The images of their performances confirm that humor and laughter are the best therapy against depression and discouragement. Another trip to war-torn Ukraine is captured in Scream of My Blood: A Gogol Bordello Story by American director Nate Pommer, which received a Special Jury Mention for the Albert Maysles Award for Emerging Documentary Director. Charismatic and frenetic leader Eugene Goodz and his legendary rock band, one might say, have become the epitome of muses who cannot be silent in a terrible time of war. The 30-minute short Captains of Ukraine was directed by Matt Danzigo, an American filmmaker and reporter with BBC and NBC experience. The players of the Ukrainian football team are faced with a difficult choice: continue to practice professional sport or take up arms and go to the front? There were no Russian films on the festival program this time around. In the fantasy thriller “ISS”. (ISS), featured in the Spotlight Narrative section, stars two Russian-born actors, Costa Ronin and Masha Mashkova. It was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who is listed in the catalog as a Brazilian-American. Gabriela Cowperthwaite and Masha Mashkova. Photo: Oleg Sulkin Supplies have arrived at the International Space Station, and now here in orbit, three American astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts are on science watch. The status quo is supported by expressions of mutual sympathy, friendship and even love. But the idyll ends when disturbing information arrives from Earth. Something tragic has happened in the world, and the inhabitants of the station stare in horror through the windows at the once blue planet, engulfed in a red glow. Conservatives in Russia and America pass the same secret instruction to “their” envoys in orbit – to gain full control of the station at all costs. The Tribeca Festival was founded in late 2001 by actor Robert De Niro and fellow producers Jane Rosenthal and her husband Craig Hathcoff as the New York creative community’s response to the September 11 attacks. The founders of the festival saw it as a way to revive and diversify the life of the metropolis. Today, the Tribeca Festival has become an integral part of its cultural landscape.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul. Following on from his comments about his \"little brother\", the 24-year-old has added fuel to the fire that is the speculation surrounding his fellow Frenchman. In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work. He's still very young but he has an incredible margin for improvement so I'm confident.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:49:42","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27148241.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_konatethuram2.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Why Marty Walsh left the Biden administration to run the NHL players' union","link":"https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/national-sports/why-marty-walsh-left-the-biden-administration-to-run-the-nhl-players-union/","keywords":["National Sports","AP Sports"],"creator":["STEPHEN WHYNO, Associated Press"],"video_url":null,"description":"Marty Walsh wasn't a man in a hurry to leave the Biden administration.

Less than halfway through the president’s term, Walsh was in a comfortable spot in the Cabinet as labor secretary. Then he got a call about an interesting opportunity: running the NHL Players’ Association. The former mayor of Boston and longtime Bruins fan was intrigued and earlier this year accepted the role as executive director. Now three months in, Walsh is trying to get to know players and what they care about most, learning about everything from the Arizona Coyotes’ arena situation to the salary cap and future international competition. “This job is more like being the mayor,” Walsh said in a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press during the Stanley Cup Final in Las Vegas. “You wake up in the morning, you’re planning on a smooth day and there’s an issue that pops, and that’s the issue of the moment. And then when that issue’s over, there’s another issue that comes right behind it. And if there’s a celebration on anything, that celebration’s short-lived because you’re on to the next issue.” With the current collective bargaining agreement in place through the 2025-26 season, the most pressing issue concerns the Coyotes, set to go into a second season in a 5,000-seat rink on Arizona State’s campus after a referendum for a new arena in Tempe failed. Walsh has met more with Arizona’s players than anyone else among the nearly 200 members he has spoken to so far. “These are National Hockey League players playing in a college arena,” Walsh said. “Players that are heading into the prime of their career now playing in this arena for a couple seasons — it’s just not right. It’s not good for the game.” When Walsh speaks to players, he finds out what they think is good or not so good for the game. Many, like Connor McDavid, prioritize returning to the Olympics after a lengthy absence and getting a World Cup of Hockey on the schedule, while others are more concerned with the cap going up and keeping escrow payments down. Several months after helping the U.S. avert a nationwide rail strike, this job hearkens back to the days when Walsh was president of the Laborers’ Union Local 223 in Massachusetts. With players aged 18-38 in various stages of their careers, he said the NHLPA membership is diverse in what it cares about, just like any other workplace. “One thing I’ve learned quickly is that this truly is a union because every player has a different concern,” Walsh said. “And I think it’s important for me to get to know the membership so I can represent them the best I can, understanding the challenges they have.” Walsh, 56, also has gotten to know Commissioner Gary Bettman since taking over in March. They attended an event together at the Canadian Embassy in Washington in April and have met several times to discuss the cap, the Coyotes and more. “To me, the vital signs seem good,” Bettman told the AP recently. “We’re getting better acquainted. I like him. I respect him. I think he’s smart. I think he’s going to be good for the players, and I look forward to working with him.” Walsh called it a “very cordial working relationship,” while acknowledging there will be disagreements ahead “that put us on two different sides of a fence — and we will have to deal with that when the time comes.” Collective bargaining talks in the coming years almost certainly will bring that conflict. Kevin Shattenkirk, a veteran defenseman who was on the search committee, said Walsh was engaging and commanding right away and gave out his cellphone number to players to call any time after his first interview. “Part of his pitch was that he was going to be readily available to players at any moment — any time that we needed him,” Shattenkirk said Sunday. “With his experience in working in labor unions, I think he knows how important that is. It’s important for the head of it to be accessible and also at the same time to be strong and powerful and know which way he’s leading his organization.” For now, Walsh is trying to lead the way in preparing players for life after hockey and growing the game beyond the nearly $6 billion in revenue. He watches football, basketball and baseball differently since shifting from politics to sports, thinking about what other leagues have done and how it might apply to the NHL. Walsh is a fan of increasing interest in Sweden and other places in Europe with games there and wonders about opportunities for hockey in Latin American countries and among underserved populations in North America. “We have teams like the Dallas Stars and the Coyotes and even the (Florida) Panthers to some degree: large Latino populations,” Walsh said. “You think of Boston — are we tapping into Latino population in Boston, New York, Chicago, places like that?” Just getting a chance to tackle tasks like that excites Walsh, who said he still has a very strong, close friendship with Joe Biden. The president, when Walsh left in February, called him “one tough union chief” and a model for future labor secretaries. This is just a different challenge, one that Walsh feels his entire career has prepared him for. “There’s not many opportunities that probably could have come on my plate that I would’ve been like, ’Oh, this is perfect,’” he said. “This is kind of my whole life coming full circle: labor movement, running a union, opportunities to grow the game, to be progressive in thinking as to how do we grow the game, how do we strengthen the union.” ___ AP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports Copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

More than 200 features, shorts, animated, experimental and immersive programs have screened at Tribeca, New York’s largest film festival, held annually in Lower Manhattan since 2002. The festival took place in two dimensions. The first was traditionally represented by public screenings in several cinemas with the presence of the creators of the strips, who answered questions from the public after the screenings. The second, related to the pandemic, invited fans to stream on their computers, tablets and iPhones. For the first time on such a scale, Tribeca has opened up the opportunity for “couch” viewing fans to get acquainted with the show’s schedule, of course, for a fee. The other side of glory “Cipher” won Best American Narrative Film, and the award went to director Chris Moukarbel, who isn’t new to the theme song. He has already made several music videos. Her first feature-length documentary, Me @ The Zoo, premiered at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. Cipher, his acting debut, starred 27-year-old Tierra Wack. She first rose to prominence at the age of 15, when she stood on the streets in Philadelphia and sang rap verses for a YouTube channel with unusual expressiveness. Tierra Wack Cipher Star. Credit: AP Today, Wack is a celebrity in the latest hip-hop music subculture. She is admired by celebrities such as Erika Badu and Billie Eilish. But, as Moukarbel’s camera testifies, there is a downside to stardom. One fine evening, after a difficult performance, she notices someone watching. From then on, Tierra and her team are forced to constantly look around, suspecting they are being secretly videotaped. The aesthetic of a psychological thriller still doesn’t overwhelm the film’s artistic start, and a nugget’s talent guarantees that. Tierra clearly demonstrates with her strongly social incendiary recitatives that there is enough litter on the streets of American cities from which to sprout brilliant poems. The Brazilian “Strange Path” wins many awards in New York – for the best international film, the best screenplay, cinematography and the interpretation of the main role by Carlos Francisco. Aspiring filmmaker David returns to his native Brazil for the first time in 10 years, where he and his film have been invited to a film festival. But due to the outbreak of the pandemic, the festival is canceled and he has to live somewhere for a few days before flying out. David comes to Geraldo (Francisco), his father, whom he has not seen for many years. But he meets his descending son unexpectedly extremely hostile. Tribeca Strange Path Film Festival As festival selector Casey Baron notes, director Guto Parente makes ingenious use of the film’s hero’s experimental footage, layering it across the main narrative to highlight his mood swings and misadventures. romance and horror The smoking tiger motif in Korean culture may indicate the “humanity” of the animal. A Korean-American high school student living in Southern California is the heroine of the contemporary drama “Smoking Tigers”, which received two awards in the Tribeca’s Untold Stories competition – for best actress Chi-Yeon Yoo and for best screenplay in a playwright and directed by Seo Yeon Shelley Yo. The heroine comes from a poor family, but, pushed by her ambitious parents, she is forced to compete with her classmates from elite families obsessed with the idea of ​​entering the best universities. “Smoking Tigers” also received an honorable mention from the Nora Ephron Award jury, an American director and playwright known for her romantic comedies. The award itself went to rookie director Gabriella Moses for Boca Chica, filmed in the Dominican Republic. Desi, 12, sings in the local choir, but her ambitions are much bigger. She left her neighborhood of Boca Chica and found success as a singer in New York. Relations with loved ones back home remain strained, leading to a resounding scandal. “A Night with Adela”. Tribeca Film Festival On the border between “angry” social cinema and naturalistic horror, rookie director Hugo Ruiz wavers in the dark opus One Night With Adela. Ruiz won Best New Feature Film Director. Garbage truck driver Adela is offended by the world, but first by her parents. She is willing to resort to violence, and her plan for revenge is inventive and cruel. The Kenyan ethnographic film “Between the Rains” directed by Andrew Brown and Moses Turanier was named best documentary film. The jury noted the grace and love of the young heroes, inhabitants of a remote African village. Brown is also recognized as the best cinematographer in the category of world documentaries, which firmly adheres to the method of cinema believe. “Between the Rains” Tribeca Film Festival Prizes were also awarded in other categories – short films, audio programs, immersive programs and video games. “We are very proud of the festival’s selection of such a diverse selection of films this year,” festival director Kara Cusumano said in a statement. “Our winners and their films are a strong testament to the vitality of different genres and platforms affirming themselves in the most powerful and inspiring ways.” Laughter as therapy The interest of American documentarians for the dramatic events in Ukraine is perceptible. Special Jury Mention of the Tribeca Documentary Competition awarded to New York filmmaker David Gutnick “Rule of two walls”. (Two Walls Rule). Coming from a family of Ukrainian immigrants, the director traveled to the homeland of his ancestors to show firsthand how the younger generation of artists are resisting barbaric aggression. “War Comedy”. Tribeca Film Festival The challenge of war is eloquently illustrated by the characters of the American documentary Comedy of War: Laughter in Ukraine, directed by Christopher Walters. A group of young stand-up comedians travel through war-torn Ukraine and gather halls full of spectators who, in the words of one of the performers, are ready to laugh not to cry. The images of their performances confirm that humor and laughter are the best therapy against depression and discouragement. Another trip to war-torn Ukraine is captured in Scream of My Blood: A Gogol Bordello Story by American director Nate Pommer, which received a Special Jury Mention for the Albert Maysles Award for Emerging Documentary Director. Charismatic and frenetic leader Eugene Goodz and his legendary rock band, one might say, have become the epitome of muses who cannot be silent in a terrible time of war. The 30-minute short Captains of Ukraine was directed by Matt Danzigo, an American filmmaker and reporter with BBC and NBC experience. The players of the Ukrainian football team are faced with a difficult choice: continue to practice professional sport or take up arms and go to the front? There were no Russian films on the festival program this time around. In the fantasy thriller “ISS”. (ISS), featured in the Spotlight Narrative section, stars two Russian-born actors, Costa Ronin and Masha Mashkova. It was directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, who is listed in the catalog as a Brazilian-American. Gabriela Cowperthwaite and Masha Mashkova. Photo: Oleg Sulkin Supplies have arrived at the International Space Station, and now here in orbit, three American astronauts and three Russian cosmonauts are on science watch. The status quo is supported by expressions of mutual sympathy, friendship and even love. But the idyll ends when disturbing information arrives from Earth. Something tragic has happened in the world, and the inhabitants of the station stare in horror through the windows at the once blue planet, engulfed in a red glow. Conservatives in Russia and America pass the same secret instruction to “their” envoys in orbit – to gain full control of the station at all costs. The Tribeca Festival was founded in late 2001 by actor Robert De Niro and fellow producers Jane Rosenthal and her husband Craig Hathcoff as the New York creative community’s response to the September 11 attacks. The founders of the festival saw it as a way to revive and diversify the life of the metropolis. Today, the Tribeca Festival has become an integral part of its cultural landscape.

The Black Stars needed a win a win to qualify for the next edition of the tournament in Cote D’Ivoire but the Malagasy put up a brave performance to delay Ghana’s qualification. Chris Hughton named Andre Ayew in the starting line for the first time since the 2-0 loss to Uruguay in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Kamal Deen Sulemana and Joseph Painstil operated on the wings as Jordan Ayew led the likes in a four back system that featured Denis Odoi, Joseph Aidoo, Daniel Martey and debutant Patrick Kpozo. Ghana started the game the better side and had their first chance from a free kick which was whipped in by Jordan Ayew but was cleverly dealt with by Madagascar. The hosts came close in the 15th minute after Dorian Bertrand sent in a cross which found no one in the box. Kamaldeen Sulemana later saw his curler miss the post by inches, Joseph Paintsil fired from a rebound but the shot did not trouble the host - much to the relief of their fans. Bertrand and Carulos Andriamatsinoro combined on the left to give Ghana a scare but the last touch failed to get its intended power. Chances were far and few in the closing stages of the first half as the whistle blew for the break. Madagascar came back from the break looking to break the deadlock but the Ghana back line were equal to the task. Thomas Partey forced a save from the Madagascar goalkeeper from a set piece before Chris Hughton introduced Ernest Nuamah in place of Kamal Deen Sulemana. Serbia based winger Osman Bukari replaced Joseph Painstil. The former had a chance to score the winner for the Black Stars but his control was not the best as he fluffed the chance. Mohammed Kudus was later brought on for Jordan Ayew as Ghana continued to pile pressure for the winner but the Malagasy put the breaks on him as the game winded up. The hosts then resorted to ball retention and time wasting as the referee blew his whistle to end proceedings. With the 0-0 score line, Ghana need a win in their last game against Central African Republic in September to qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cote D’Ivoire.

The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

Son, who plays for Shandong Taishan in the Chinese Super League, has been held in Liaoning province since mid-May on what Chinese officials have said are bribery charges. \"The public authorities who have been investigating Son Jun-ho have received approval for his arrest from the prosecution,\" the source said, noting the period of detention expired Saturday. \"The switch to an investigation under arrest means that the public security authorities have begun taking formal legal steps against Son Jun-ho.\" Once an arrest is approved, public security authorities typically take around two months to carry out a deeper investigation before taking steps for an indictment, the source said. \"However, in serious cases, it can take up to several months before the indictment,\" the source said.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three. It was another disappointing game for Van Dijk as he rounded off his 2023-24 season with a defeat, the pair will not join up with their teammates for international duty until September.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 17:04:51","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26724153.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_rafjpeg.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton want to sign England int'l for free amid Friday Arsenal news - report","link":"https://www.goodisonnews.com/2023/06/18/everton-transfer-news-ainsley-maitland-niles-targeted-after-confirmed-arsenal-exit/","keywords":["News","Players","Transfers","Ainsley Maitland-Niles","Arsenal","everton"],"creator":["George Overhill"],"video_url":null,"description":"Everton are targeting Ainsley Maitland-Niles again after the England international’s exit from Arsenal, according to Football Transfers.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul. Following on from his comments about his \"little brother\", the 24-year-old has added fuel to the fire that is the speculation surrounding his fellow Frenchman. In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work.

The Black Stars needed a win a win to qualify for the next edition of the tournament in Cote D’Ivoire but the Malagasy put up a brave performance to delay Ghana’s qualification. Chris Hughton named Andre Ayew in the starting line for the first time since the 2-0 loss to Uruguay in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Kamal Deen Sulemana and Joseph Painstil operated on the wings as Jordan Ayew led the likes in a four back system that featured Denis Odoi, Joseph Aidoo, Daniel Martey and debutant Patrick Kpozo. Ghana started the game the better side and had their first chance from a free kick which was whipped in by Jordan Ayew but was cleverly dealt with by Madagascar. The hosts came close in the 15th minute after Dorian Bertrand sent in a cross which found no one in the box. Kamaldeen Sulemana later saw his curler miss the post by inches, Joseph Paintsil fired from a rebound but the shot did not trouble the host - much to the relief of their fans. Bertrand and Carulos Andriamatsinoro combined on the left to give Ghana a scare but the last touch failed to get its intended power. Chances were far and few in the closing stages of the first half as the whistle blew for the break. Madagascar came back from the break looking to break the deadlock but the Ghana back line were equal to the task. Thomas Partey forced a save from the Madagascar goalkeeper from a set piece before Chris Hughton introduced Ernest Nuamah in place of Kamal Deen Sulemana. Serbia based winger Osman Bukari replaced Joseph Painstil. The former had a chance to score the winner for the Black Stars but his control was not the best as he fluffed the chance. Mohammed Kudus was later brought on for Jordan Ayew as Ghana continued to pile pressure for the winner but the Malagasy put the breaks on him as the game winded up. The hosts then resorted to ball retention and time wasting as the referee blew his whistle to end proceedings. With the 0-0 score line, Ghana need a win in their last game against Central African Republic in September to qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cote D’Ivoire.

I am sure they will be better in the next match.\" Son Heung-min of South Korea salutes fans after the team's 1-0 loss to Peru in a friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Son was a limited participant in training sessions throughout the week and is believed to be experiencing difficulties shooting the ball. \"This was our first match in Busan in four years, and I wanted to play well here,\" Son said. \"But I made the decision to sit out this game after consulting with the coach (Jurgen Klinsmann).\" Korea's next match is against El Salvador on Tuesday. \"We have a lot of time until then, so we will see what happens,\" Son said when asked about his status.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side.

I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work.

The Black Stars needed a win a win to qualify for the next edition of the tournament in Cote D’Ivoire but the Malagasy put up a brave performance to delay Ghana’s qualification. Chris Hughton named Andre Ayew in the starting line for the first time since the 2-0 loss to Uruguay in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Kamal Deen Sulemana and Joseph Painstil operated on the wings as Jordan Ayew led the likes in a four back system that featured Denis Odoi, Joseph Aidoo, Daniel Martey and debutant Patrick Kpozo. Ghana started the game the better side and had their first chance from a free kick which was whipped in by Jordan Ayew but was cleverly dealt with by Madagascar. The hosts came close in the 15th minute after Dorian Bertrand sent in a cross which found no one in the box. Kamaldeen Sulemana later saw his curler miss the post by inches, Joseph Paintsil fired from a rebound but the shot did not trouble the host - much to the relief of their fans. Bertrand and Carulos Andriamatsinoro combined on the left to give Ghana a scare but the last touch failed to get its intended power. Chances were far and few in the closing stages of the first half as the whistle blew for the break. Madagascar came back from the break looking to break the deadlock but the Ghana back line were equal to the task. Thomas Partey forced a save from the Madagascar goalkeeper from a set piece before Chris Hughton introduced Ernest Nuamah in place of Kamal Deen Sulemana. Serbia based winger Osman Bukari replaced Joseph Painstil. The former had a chance to score the winner for the Black Stars but his control was not the best as he fluffed the chance. Mohammed Kudus was later brought on for Jordan Ayew as Ghana continued to pile pressure for the winner but the Malagasy put the breaks on him as the game winded up. The hosts then resorted to ball retention and time wasting as the referee blew his whistle to end proceedings. With the 0-0 score line, Ghana need a win in their last game against Central African Republic in September to qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cote D’Ivoire.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul. Following on from his comments about his \"little brother\", the 24-year-old has added fuel to the fire that is the speculation surrounding his fellow Frenchman. In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work. He's still very young but he has an incredible margin for improvement so I'm confident.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:49:42","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27148241.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_konatethuram2.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"}],"nextPage":"1687106982e1441c7cce2a9f93e8686ba054e0123c"}

The Black Stars needed a win a win to qualify for the next edition of the tournament in Cote D’Ivoire but the Malagasy put up a brave performance to delay Ghana’s qualification. Chris Hughton named Andre Ayew in the starting line for the first time since the 2-0 loss to Uruguay in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Kamal Deen Sulemana and Joseph Painstil operated on the wings as Jordan Ayew led the likes in a four back system that featured Denis Odoi, Joseph Aidoo, Daniel Martey and debutant Patrick Kpozo. Ghana started the game the better side and had their first chance from a free kick which was whipped in by Jordan Ayew but was cleverly dealt with by Madagascar. The hosts came close in the 15th minute after Dorian Bertrand sent in a cross which found no one in the box. Kamaldeen Sulemana later saw his curler miss the post by inches, Joseph Paintsil fired from a rebound but the shot did not trouble the host - much to the relief of their fans. Bertrand and Carulos Andriamatsinoro combined on the left to give Ghana a scare but the last touch failed to get its intended power. Chances were far and few in the closing stages of the first half as the whistle blew for the break. Madagascar came back from the break looking to break the deadlock but the Ghana back line were equal to the task. Thomas Partey forced a save from the Madagascar goalkeeper from a set piece before Chris Hughton introduced Ernest Nuamah in place of Kamal Deen Sulemana. Serbia based winger Osman Bukari replaced Joseph Painstil. The former had a chance to score the winner for the Black Stars but his control was not the best as he fluffed the chance. Mohammed Kudus was later brought on for Jordan Ayew as Ghana continued to pile pressure for the winner but the Malagasy put the breaks on him as the game winded up. The hosts then resorted to ball retention and time wasting as the referee blew his whistle to end proceedings. With the 0-0 score line, Ghana need a win in their last game against Central African Republic in September to qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cote D’Ivoire.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul. Following on from his comments about his \"little brother\", the 24-year-old has added fuel to the fire that is the speculation surrounding his fellow Frenchman. In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work. He's still very young but he has an incredible margin for improvement so I'm confident.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:49:42","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27148241.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_konatethuram2.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"}],"nextPage":"1687106982e1441c7cce2a9f93e8686ba054e0123c"}

The Black Stars needed a win a win to qualify for the next edition of the tournament in Cote D’Ivoire but the Malagasy put up a brave performance to delay Ghana’s qualification. Chris Hughton named Andre Ayew in the starting line for the first time since the 2-0 loss to Uruguay in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Kamal Deen Sulemana and Joseph Painstil operated on the wings as Jordan Ayew led the likes in a four back system that featured Denis Odoi, Joseph Aidoo, Daniel Martey and debutant Patrick Kpozo. Ghana started the game the better side and had their first chance from a free kick which was whipped in by Jordan Ayew but was cleverly dealt with by Madagascar. The hosts came close in the 15th minute after Dorian Bertrand sent in a cross which found no one in the box. Kamaldeen Sulemana later saw his curler miss the post by inches, Joseph Paintsil fired from a rebound but the shot did not trouble the host - much to the relief of their fans. Bertrand and Carulos Andriamatsinoro combined on the left to give Ghana a scare but the last touch failed to get its intended power. Chances were far and few in the closing stages of the first half as the whistle blew for the break. Madagascar came back from the break looking to break the deadlock but the Ghana back line were equal to the task. Thomas Partey forced a save from the Madagascar goalkeeper from a set piece before Chris Hughton introduced Ernest Nuamah in place of Kamal Deen Sulemana. Serbia based winger Osman Bukari replaced Joseph Painstil. The former had a chance to score the winner for the Black Stars but his control was not the best as he fluffed the chance. Mohammed Kudus was later brought on for Jordan Ayew as Ghana continued to pile pressure for the winner but the Malagasy put the breaks on him as the game winded up. The hosts then resorted to ball retention and time wasting as the referee blew his whistle to end proceedings. With the 0-0 score line, Ghana need a win in their last game against Central African Republic in September to qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cote D’Ivoire.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul. Following on from his comments about his \"little brother\", the 24-year-old has added fuel to the fire that is the speculation surrounding his fellow Frenchman. In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work. He's still very young but he has an incredible margin for improvement so I'm confident.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:49:42","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27148241.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_konatethuram2.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"}],"nextPage":"1687106982e1441c7cce2a9f93e8686ba054e0123c"}

The Black Stars needed a win a win to qualify for the next edition of the tournament in Cote D’Ivoire but the Malagasy put up a brave performance to delay Ghana’s qualification. Chris Hughton named Andre Ayew in the starting line for the first time since the 2-0 loss to Uruguay in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Kamal Deen Sulemana and Joseph Painstil operated on the wings as Jordan Ayew led the likes in a four back system that featured Denis Odoi, Joseph Aidoo, Daniel Martey and debutant Patrick Kpozo. Ghana started the game the better side and had their first chance from a free kick which was whipped in by Jordan Ayew but was cleverly dealt with by Madagascar. The hosts came close in the 15th minute after Dorian Bertrand sent in a cross which found no one in the box. Kamaldeen Sulemana later saw his curler miss the post by inches, Joseph Paintsil fired from a rebound but the shot did not trouble the host - much to the relief of their fans. Bertrand and Carulos Andriamatsinoro combined on the left to give Ghana a scare but the last touch failed to get its intended power. Chances were far and few in the closing stages of the first half as the whistle blew for the break. Madagascar came back from the break looking to break the deadlock but the Ghana back line were equal to the task. Thomas Partey forced a save from the Madagascar goalkeeper from a set piece before Chris Hughton introduced Ernest Nuamah in place of Kamal Deen Sulemana. Serbia based winger Osman Bukari replaced Joseph Painstil. The former had a chance to score the winner for the Black Stars but his control was not the best as he fluffed the chance. Mohammed Kudus was later brought on for Jordan Ayew as Ghana continued to pile pressure for the winner but the Malagasy put the breaks on him as the game winded up. The hosts then resorted to ball retention and time wasting as the referee blew his whistle to end proceedings. With the 0-0 score line, Ghana need a win in their last game against Central African Republic in September to qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cote D’Ivoire.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

Yonhap Chinese public security authorities have placed Korean midfielder Son Jun-ho under formal arrest on bribery charges following the expiration of his detention period, a source familiar with the case said Sunday. Son, who plays for Shandong Taishan in the Chinese Super League, has been held in Liaoning province since mid-May on what Chinese officials have said are bribery charges. \"The public authorities who have been investigating Son Jun-ho have received approval for his arrest from the prosecution,\" the source said, noting the period of detention expired Saturday. \"The switch to an investigation under arrest means that the public security authorities have begun taking formal legal steps against Son Jun-ho.\" Once an arrest is approved, public security authorities typically take around two months to carry out a deeper investigation before taking steps for an indictment, the source said. \"However, in serious cases, it can take up to several months before the indictment,\" the source said.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three. It was another disappointing game for Van Dijk as he rounded off his 2023-24 season with a defeat, the pair will not join up with their teammates for international duty until September.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 17:04:51","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26724153.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_rafjpeg.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton want to sign England int'l for free amid Friday Arsenal news - report","link":"https://www.goodisonnews.com/2023/06/18/everton-transfer-news-ainsley-maitland-niles-targeted-after-confirmed-arsenal-exit/","keywords":["News","Players","Transfers","Ainsley Maitland-Niles","Arsenal","everton"],"creator":["George Overhill"],"video_url":null,"description":"Everton are targeting Ainsley Maitland-Niles again after the England international’s exit from Arsenal, according to Football Transfers.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul. Following on from his comments about his \"little brother\", the 24-year-old has added fuel to the fire that is the speculation surrounding his fellow Frenchman. In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work. He's still very young but he has an incredible margin for improvement so I'm confident.\"","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:49:42","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article27148241.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/0_konatethuram2.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"}],"nextPage":"1687106982e1441c7cce2a9f93e8686ba054e0123c"}

The Black Stars needed a win a win to qualify for the next edition of the tournament in Cote D’Ivoire but the Malagasy put up a brave performance to delay Ghana’s qualification. Chris Hughton named Andre Ayew in the starting line for the first time since the 2-0 loss to Uruguay in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Kamal Deen Sulemana and Joseph Painstil operated on the wings as Jordan Ayew led the likes in a four back system that featured Denis Odoi, Joseph Aidoo, Daniel Martey and debutant Patrick Kpozo. Ghana started the game the better side and had their first chance from a free kick which was whipped in by Jordan Ayew but was cleverly dealt with by Madagascar. The hosts came close in the 15th minute after Dorian Bertrand sent in a cross which found no one in the box. Kamaldeen Sulemana later saw his curler miss the post by inches, Joseph Paintsil fired from a rebound but the shot did not trouble the host - much to the relief of their fans. Bertrand and Carulos Andriamatsinoro combined on the left to give Ghana a scare but the last touch failed to get its intended power. Chances were far and few in the closing stages of the first half as the whistle blew for the break. Madagascar came back from the break looking to break the deadlock but the Ghana back line were equal to the task. Thomas Partey forced a save from the Madagascar goalkeeper from a set piece before Chris Hughton introduced Ernest Nuamah in place of Kamal Deen Sulemana. Serbia based winger Osman Bukari replaced Joseph Painstil. The former had a chance to score the winner for the Black Stars but his control was not the best as he fluffed the chance. Mohammed Kudus was later brought on for Jordan Ayew as Ghana continued to pile pressure for the winner but the Malagasy put the breaks on him as the game winded up. The hosts then resorted to ball retention and time wasting as the referee blew his whistle to end proceedings. With the 0-0 score line, Ghana need a win in their last game against Central African Republic in September to qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cote D’Ivoire.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate.

Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

Son, who plays for Shandong Taishan in the Chinese Super League, has been held in Liaoning province since mid-May on what Chinese officials have said are bribery charges. \"The public authorities who have been investigating Son Jun-ho have received approval for his arrest from the prosecution,\" the source said, noting the period of detention expired Saturday. \"The switch to an investigation under arrest means that the public security authorities have begun taking formal legal steps against Son Jun-ho.\" Once an arrest is approved, public security authorities typically take around two months to carry out a deeper investigation before taking steps for an indictment, the source said. \"However, in serious cases, it can take up to several months before the indictment,\" the source said.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three. It was another disappointing game for Van Dijk as he rounded off his 2023-24 season with a defeat, the pair will not join up with their teammates for international duty until September.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 17:04:51","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26724153.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_rafjpeg.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton want to sign England int'l for free amid Friday Arsenal news - report","link":"https://www.goodisonnews.com/2023/06/18/everton-transfer-news-ainsley-maitland-niles-targeted-after-confirmed-arsenal-exit/","keywords":["News","Players","Transfers","Ainsley Maitland-Niles","Arsenal","everton"],"creator":["George Overhill"],"video_url":null,"description":"Everton are targeting Ainsley Maitland-Niles again after the England international’s exit from Arsenal, according to Football Transfers.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

The France U21 midfielder is currently preparing for Les Bleus campaign in the European Championships this summer as they look to be crowned champions of the continent in Georgia and Romania. Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side. Any prospective transfer would not go through until July 1, when the international window opens, but the Reds are looking to bolster their engine room with the midfielder under consideration. Already has penned terms with as the first jigsaw in the puzzle of the midfield overhaul. Following on from his comments about his \"little brother\", the 24-year-old has added fuel to the fire that is the speculation surrounding his fellow Frenchman. In a quickfire 'Yes or No' with the broadcaster , Konate alongside Bayern Munich defender Dayot Upamecano was asked if Thuram will be playing alongside him at Anfield this season. \"Yes, I hope so,\" he replied. He is currently with Didier Deschamps' senior squad as their European Championships qualification continues. They beat Gibraltar on Friday and host Greece in the France capital on Monday. Despite being away from duty with Klopp's squad, has been vocal in the transfer plans on Merseyside this summer and in particular over the prospect of earning a French teammate at club level. Speaking to , he said: \"I would be very happy for him [Thuram] to come to Liverpool and I would take him under my wing and I would do everything for him to progress and become the player he wants to become.\" \"Khephren is like my little brother, he's someone I saw growing up. I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work.

The Black Stars needed a win a win to qualify for the next edition of the tournament in Cote D’Ivoire but the Malagasy put up a brave performance to delay Ghana’s qualification. Chris Hughton named Andre Ayew in the starting line for the first time since the 2-0 loss to Uruguay in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Kamal Deen Sulemana and Joseph Painstil operated on the wings as Jordan Ayew led the likes in a four back system that featured Denis Odoi, Joseph Aidoo, Daniel Martey and debutant Patrick Kpozo. Ghana started the game the better side and had their first chance from a free kick which was whipped in by Jordan Ayew but was cleverly dealt with by Madagascar. The hosts came close in the 15th minute after Dorian Bertrand sent in a cross which found no one in the box. Kamaldeen Sulemana later saw his curler miss the post by inches, Joseph Paintsil fired from a rebound but the shot did not trouble the host - much to the relief of their fans. Bertrand and Carulos Andriamatsinoro combined on the left to give Ghana a scare but the last touch failed to get its intended power. Chances were far and few in the closing stages of the first half as the whistle blew for the break. Madagascar came back from the break looking to break the deadlock but the Ghana back line were equal to the task. Thomas Partey forced a save from the Madagascar goalkeeper from a set piece before Chris Hughton introduced Ernest Nuamah in place of Kamal Deen Sulemana. Serbia based winger Osman Bukari replaced Joseph Painstil. The former had a chance to score the winner for the Black Stars but his control was not the best as he fluffed the chance. Mohammed Kudus was later brought on for Jordan Ayew as Ghana continued to pile pressure for the winner but the Malagasy put the breaks on him as the game winded up. The hosts then resorted to ball retention and time wasting as the referee blew his whistle to end proceedings. With the 0-0 score line, Ghana need a win in their last game against Central African Republic in September to qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cote D’Ivoire.

Yonhap With Korea missing a few key players for a men's football friendly against Peru on Friday night, head coach Jurgen Klinsmann insisted in the leadup to the contest that this would present an opportunity for new players to step up. Klinsmann, in particular, wanted less experienced players to make a statement and push for their inclusion for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup in January next year. Those players, though, let their coach down. Bryan Reyna scored in the 11th minute for Peru, and the visitors held on for their 1-0 win at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in this southeastern city of Busan. Peru were in control for most of the first half, with South Korea barely threatening their opponents. South Korean talisman and captain Son Heung-min sat out the match while recovering from a recent sports hernia surgery. And without the Tottenham Hotspur star, South Korea's offense exhibited very little flow. The defense corps also played without some important names, with Napoli defender Kim Min-jae out while completing his mandatory military training and Ulsan Hyundai FC veteran Kim Young-gwon nursing a thigh injury. South Korea's new-look defense looked flustered early against Peru's high pressing. Right fullback Ahn Hyun-beom played in his first international match and looked the part of the rookie at times. Ahn's turnover deep in his own zone resulted in Peru's goal. Ahn appeared to have lost confidence from that point on, unable to make seemingly simple outlet passes from his own zone. In the first half, South Korean attackers were often frustrated by physical and speedy defenders, who gave the hosts precious little room to operate. Lee Kang-in of South Korea prepares to take a corner against Peru for the ball during the teams' friendly football match at Busan Asiad Main Stadium in Busan, 320 kilometers southeast of Seoul, June 16. Yonhap Klinsmann was diplomatic when evaluating his new players, saying it gave him and his staff a chance to see different players in a match setting. \"When I don't win, I'm angry. It's normal. But the more important thing is that we see who's growing,\" the coach said. \"I am thankful that I get this opportunity to bring new players in and give them a chance. Obviously, I'd like to have Min-jae and Sonny. But overall, this is a great group of players to work with. I'm impressed with their discipline, with their work ethic and with their focus.\" Midfielder Lee Kang-in was the lone bright spot for South Korea, firing shots and generating chances for his teammates. The RCD Mallorca youngster flashed the kind of skills and creativity that make him such a popular player at home and a coveted talent during the summer transfer window. Lee registered South Korea's first shot on target in the 33rd minute, when his left-footed effort from the right corner of the box tested Pedro Gallese. In the second half, Lee grabbed South Korea by the collar and singlehandedly led the offensive surge. He made a deft pass to set up forward Oh Hyeon-gyu on a one-on-one opportunity against Gallese in the 62nd minute, but Oh failed to get his low shot past the Peruvian goalkeeper. Lee got off a rare header in the 73rd minute, as it bounced in front of the goal and went off Gallese's hands. Lee found the head of Cho Gue-sung's head twice in the late stretches, conjuring the successful partnership that produced two goals at last year's FIFA World Cup. The duo wasn't so dynamic this time, as Cho missed the target with both attempts. Klinsmann reserved high praise for Lee afterward, calling him a \"very, very special player.\" Klinsmann noticed how Peru often surrounded Lee with multiple players when he had the ball because \"they have a lot of respect for him.\" \"His way of playing is exciting. He's always creative. He's always there trying hard, but obviously he cannot win it by himself,\" the coach added. \"For Kang-in, this is a really important learning curve, learning when to dribble and when to just make one-touch passes to free himself up.\" Lee was much harder on himself and said he was disappointed he couldn't help the team win. \"I didn't do anything well. I am just devastated that we didn't win,\" Lee said. \"The most important thing is to win. We play football to win, and we will try to take the next match. I believe we will get better and better.\" Park Ji-su, one of two new starting center backs, was guilty of some ball-watching moments in the first half but exhibited some offensive skills in the latter half. His aggressive forward passes caught Peruvian defenders off guard and created some opportunities for the hosts. None of these chances, though, resulted in a goal. Klinsmann is still looking for his first win as South Korea's bench boss. The team had a 2-2 draw against Colombia and suffered a 2-1 loss to Uruguay in March.

It was another defeat for Ronald Koeman's side as Italy claimed third-place in the competition. Headed by former Manchester City boss, Roberto Mancini, they raced into a two-goal first-half lead in Enschede. Federico Dimarco and Davide Frattesi put them into the lead after 20 minutes. The former Everton manager made three changes at the break with Steven Bergwijn making an instant impact by halving the deficit. However, the one-goal disadvantage was shortlived as Federico Chiesa made it 3-1 with 18 minutes remaining. There was enough time for another Holland goal as former midfielder Gini Wijnaldum caused some concern for the Italians going into nine minutes of second-half stoppage time - however, they held their nerve to cement third place in the 2023 UEFA Nations League. Van der Vaart, who hasn't been shy to criticise in the past, continued to take aim at the Liverpool defender. The 31-year-old was jockeying Chiesa before the Juventus man weaved in to out slotting past Justin Bijlow into the far corner. “Virgil van Dijk is being criticised and rightly so,\" the former Real Madrid and Tottenham Hotspur midfielder told Dutch outlet NOS. \"For 20 minutes I thought: he is back, but that moment with Chiesa.. he is basically doing nothing. \"We are missing Matthijs de Ligt in his current form, let’s not forget that.\" His teammate, , played the entirety of their defeat on Dutch soil as he started down the middle of a front three. It was another disappointing game for Van Dijk as he rounded off his 2023-24 season with a defeat, the pair will not join up with their teammates for international duty until September.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 17:04:51","image_url":"https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article26724153.ece/ALTERNATES/s98/2_rafjpeg.jpg","source_id":"liverpoolecho","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"Everton want to sign England int'l for free amid Friday Arsenal news - report","link":"https://www.goodisonnews.com/2023/06/18/everton-transfer-news-ainsley-maitland-niles-targeted-after-confirmed-arsenal-exit/","keywords":["News","Players","Transfers","Ainsley Maitland-Niles","Arsenal","everton"],"creator":["George Overhill"],"video_url":null,"description":"Everton are targeting Ainsley Maitland-Niles again after the England international’s exit from Arsenal, according to Football Transfers.

The Gunners his exit at the expiry of his contract on Friday (16 June), and now that he is a free agent Everton are one of a number of sides reportedly “keeping an eye” on him. reports that the interest comes as planned contract talks with Tom Davies face being unsuccessful if the former Everton academy product rejects an extension in search of more game time. The 24-year-old’s own deal is set to expire at the end of June and has been offered new terms, yet the “general feeling” is that he will still leave. Davies’ departure after relatively little match action would be , but with the transfer budget not thought to be extensive a cheap replacement would likely be needed. Maitland-Niles, 25, has experience in central midfield but has spent more time on the right flank, or as an auxiliary right-sided wing-back. His signing could therefore potentially kill two birds with one stone for Sean Dyche, who is after an injury crisis left him short of options to end the season. If there are a number of teams in for the five-cap former Arsenal man then Everton won’t be able to wait around because free agents can quickly get snapped up. It appears that the manager would like to keep Davies in place, but if the player is understandably after more game time at his age Dyche may not be able to guarantee that amid a crowded midfield pecking order. If the Finch Farm graduate is to leave then the decision would be better made sooner rather than later to prevent the club moving onto incoming moves that might not hang around for long.","pubDate":"2023-06-18 16:59:28","image_url":"https://www.goodisonnews.comhttps://www.goodisonnews.com/static/uploads/6/2023/06/Everton-Google-3-3-1024x703.jpg","source_id":"goodisonnews","category":["sports"],"country":["united kingdom"],"language":"english"},{"title":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","link":"https://actualite.cd/2023/06/18/rdc-lactualite-de-la-semaine-vue-par-viviane-kitete","keywords":null,"creator":["Patient"],"video_url":null,"description":"RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete Image media PHOTO-2023-06-17-20-10-01.jpg Patient dim 18/06/2023 - 17:57 Femme Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethni En savoir plus sur RDC : l’actualité de la semaine vue par Viviane Kitete","content":"Du boycott de la plénière tablant sur la répartition des sièges au niveau du Sénat à l’inauguration d’une usine d’assemblage des véhicules en passant par la première année d’occupation par le M23 de Bunagana ou encore le conflit interethnique à Kwamouth, la semaine qui s’achève a été riche au niveau de l’actualité. Viviane Kitete Okandjo passe en revue chacun de ces faits marquants. Bonjour Madame Viviane Kitete et merci de nous accorder de votre temps. Pouvez-vous nous parler de votre parcours et de vos activités ? Viviane Kitete : Je suis juriste de formation, avocate de profession et par vocation, défenseure des droits de l’Homme, particulièrement les droits de l’enfant et de la femme. Actuellement, j’occupe les fonctions de chargée d’études au Ministère de la Justice et Garde des sceaux. En termes d’activités, je suis coordonnatrice nationale d’une organisation dénommée « Centre de Rééducation pour l’Enfance délinquante et défavorisée », en sigle CREDD qui existe depuis 1999. Nous défendons les droits des enfants en général et des enfants en conflit avec la loi en particulier, des filles victimes des violences sexuelles, des enfants orphelins qui ont besoin d’une assistance judiciaire et d’un accompagnement juridique, nous défendons également les droits des veuves. En tant que juriste, nos actions sont caractérisées par la maîtrise d’outils, des conventions, des instruments juridiques internationaux, régionaux et nationaux. Le Sénat a adopté lundi, le projet de loi portant répartition des sièges, malgré le boycott des membres du FCC. La même attitude a été observée au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale. Quelle lecture faites-vous de cette position du FCC ? Viviane Kitete : si nous avons bonne mémoire, en 2006, l’Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS) a commis une erreur semblable, appelant ses partisans à ne point se faire enrôler. En fin de compte, le processus électoral ne s’est pas arrêté. Ils ont par contre été victime de leur instruction. S'agissant du Front Commun pour le Congo, je pense que l’histoire les rattrape. Ils donnent l’impression qu’un mot d’ordre a été donné dès le commencement du processus électoral, pour qu’ils ne participent à aucune étape. (…) A ce niveau, le processus électoral ne devrait pas s’arrêter. Ce pays a besoin de se développer et la démocratie doit se concrétiser. Les acteurs du FCC ont pris un engagement et ils doivent l’assumer jusqu’au bout. En tant que leaders Congolais, les intérêts de la population doivent primer sur tout. Toujours au sujet des élections, la CENI a annoncé le début de l'enrôlement des électeurs à Kwamouth à la date du 26 juin. Quelles dispositifs doivent être mis en place pour sécuriser les matériels et le personnel ? Viviane Kitete : nous nous en remettons au ministère de l’Intérieur et Sécurité et au ministère de la Défense Nationale. Je crois qu’ils vont mettre en œuvre tous les moyens nécessaires pour la sécurité des matériels et du personnel ainsi que le processus dans son intégralité. Le ministère des Affaires étrangères devra aussi être associé à cet exercice car il y a certains déplacés qui se trouvent notamment au Congo Brazzaville. Il va falloir également mettre à contribution le ministère de l’intégration régionale qui à leur niveau peuvent agir. Le HCR qui est un partenaire du gouvernement congolais, a les effectifs des personnes qui ont quitté Kwamouth. Toutes ces entités devront être impliquées dans les prévisions de la CENI. Cela fait une année depuis que Bunagana est sous le contrôle des M23. Une année également depuis le déclenchement des conflits à Kwamouth. Quel bilan faites-vous de l’action du gouvernement en faveur de ces deux territoires ? Viviane Kitete : je note qu’il y a eu des faits positifs tels que de nombreuses révélations autour du M23 et leurs activités. Il y a eu des rapports au niveau notamment du Conseil de sécurité des Nations Unies, des dénonciations et des appels à la cessation de soutien au M23, la RDC a déposé officiellement une plainte au niveau de la Cour Pénale Internationale, le Procureur de la CPI est venu en RDC. Et les modes opératoires de ces miliciens sont souvent les mêmes que ceux que nous voyons à Kwamouth. Nous croyons que l’instance internationale fera son travail et la RDC connaîtra l’identité des commanditaires de ces agressions et ils seront condamnés, les réparations suivront en faveur des civils. Au niveau local, les infiltrations au sein de l’armée ont été dévoilées et nous avons l’espoir que tout le réseau d’infiltration au sein de nos forces de l’ordre sera démantelé. Les efforts du gouvernement produiront des résultats. Des miliciens CODECO ont attaqué un site de déplacés en Ituri causant une cinquantaine de morts et de blessés. Il s’agit d’une cinquième attaque dans un camp de déplacés par le même groupe. Quelle réponse faut-il pour stopper ces drames ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un crime contre l’humanité. Des conventions internationales, des instruments juridiques internationaux qui interdisent qu’un site des déplacés, les écoles, les églises, soient des objets d’attaque de quelconque acteurs que ce soit. Qu’il s’agisse des miliciens, de l’armée ou des groupes armés qui se battent. Les miliciens de CODECO ainsi que leurs commanditaires devront faire l’objet des poursuites. Le Procureur de la CPI a annoncé que des enquêtes seront entamées suite à la plainte déposée par la RDC. Je crois qu’au niveau national, nos juridictions doivent également mettre la main sur les commandants de ces groupes pour qu’ils soient déférés devant les cours et tribunaux et répondent de leurs actes. Le fait qu’ils enchaînent jusqu’à cinq fois ces attaques sans être poursuivis, c’est de l’impunité. Nous n’avons plus aucune négociation, ni brassage, ni mixage à tenir avec ceux qui vont remuer le couteau dans la plaie des personnes contraintes de vivre dans un camp. En économie, le Chef de l’Etat a inauguré une usine d’assemblage de bus à Kinshasa. L’entreprise emploie environ 500 travailleurs et produira au moins 25 bus par mois dans sa phase de démarrage. Quel est d’après vous la pertinence d’un tel projet ? Viviane Kitete : c’est un projet que j’encourage parce que les résultats envisagés seront très utiles à la société congolaise. Le taux de chômage sera réduit, les difficultés liées au transport seront un tant soit peu résolues. Au niveau de l’environnement, la mise en circulation des nouveaux bus va réduire le niveau de pollution. La sécurité des populations civiles sera assurée car les bus seront une propriété de l’Etat congolais et les cas d’enlèvements vont baisser. Si deux, trois voire cinq autres usines sont ouvertes en RDC, cela aura également un impact positif sur l’économie congolaise. La RDC vient d’être élue membre du conseil d'administration de l’ITIE dont le but est d’améliorer la gestion des ressources naturelles et la transparence du secteur. Comment réagissez-vous à cette nouvelle ? Viviane Kitete : c’est une nouvelle que je reçois avec beaucoup de satisfaction. La RDC était au bas de l’échelle sur plusieurs listes. Sur le plan du climat des affaires et sur le plan international, c’est un grand pas qui vient d’être franchi. Les efforts sont en train d’être reconnus à tous les niveaux. En société, cette semaine, le monde a célébré la journée internationale de lutte contre le travail des enfants et la Journée de l’Enfant Africain. A Kinshasa, ils sont des centaines à être astreints au travail pour survivre. Quelles sont vos propositions pour mettre fin à ce phénomène ? Viviane Kitete : il existe une convention sur l’élimination des pires formes de travail des enfants. La RDC a également célébré ces journées. Mais il est vrai que face aux agressions, aux conflits armés, les enfants se trouvent contraints à travailler pour survivre. Il y a de nombreux déplacés, des enfants orphelins, des enfants associés aux groupes armés, des enfants vraiment vulnérables. La loi autorise le travail de l’enfant mais dans un contexte de travail décent. Et il faut la paix sans laquelle aucun développement n’est possible. Un emploi et un salaire décent pour les parents peut leur permettre de nourrir, scolariser et soigner leurs enfants. Nous devons lutter contre les pires formes de travail des enfants. Le gouvernement devra investir dans le ministère des affaires sociales. L’Etat doit avoir des auspices pour protéger les enfants contre les travaux d’exploitations économiques, sexuelles, numériques. Il faut également exploiter artistiquement les talents de ces enfants (le football, la musique, et autres). Le ministère de la Culture et des Arts, de la formation professionnelle, peuvent être mis à contribution. Au niveau continental, une mission africaine, dirigée par le président sud-africain Cyril Ramaphosa et le Sénégalais Macky Sall, est arrivée à Kiev pour une médiation de paix visant à mettre un terme à la guerre entre l'Ukraine et la Russie. Y parviendra-t-elle ? Viviane Kitete : je salue cette initiative. L’Afrique devrait aussi proposer ses bons offices sur des questions de paix et de réconciliation. Cependant, pour être réalistes, je doute de l’aboutissement de cette médiation. Nous avons des problèmes au niveau du continent, qu’ils n’arrivent pas à résoudre. Le cas de la RDC est criant. L’Accord-cadre d’Addis-Abeba regroupe 13 pays voisins de la région pour mettre fin à cette situation mais cela est déjà une échec. Est-ce parce que l’Union Africaine ne s’implique pas assez ou qu’elle n’a pas les moyens de sa politique ? De surcroît, comment pourront-ils mettre autour d’une table l’Ukraine et la Russie, dès lors que les Etats-Unis, l’Union Européenne, l’OTAN ont échoué ? Comment pourront-ils faire des prouesses là-bas alors que ça brûle au Soudan, au Mali ? La charité bien ordonnée commence chez soi. A l’international, au moins 79 personnes ont trouvé la mort après le naufrage d'un bateau qui transportait des centaines de migrants dans le sud-ouest de la Grèce. Quelle réponse définitive faut-il pour faire face aux naufrages des migrants ? Viviane Kitete : je regrette la mort de toutes ces personnes et présente mes condoléances à tous les proches. Sur le plan international, il existe des conventions, des textes qui doivent être mis en application pour mettre fin à ces traitements inhumains et dégradants. La personne humaine doit être protégée. Je suis indignée de voir que la communauté internationale ne prend aucune résolution pour mettre fin à ces naufrages et ce système. Le Haut-Commissariat des Réfugiés devrait s’interroger à ce sujet, pour un monde juste, il faut des résolutions pour y mettre fin. Un dernier mot ? Viviane Kitete : Merci de toujours associer le point de vue de la femme dans la gestion de la société. Elle doit participer au développement de son pays. La semaine a été une bonne semaine avec des lois adoptées au niveau de l’Assemblée Nationale et du Sénat. Le procureur de la CPI s’est prononcé sur le dossier de la RDC déposé à la Haye. Malgré quelques bémols que nous regrettons, notamment la situation de Kwamouth, je crois qu’il y a une accalmie par le fait que la CENI se prépare à organiser des élections dans ce territoire. J’appelle toute la population de Kwamouth à aller se faire enrôler, de se préparer à être éligible et voter. Nous sommes pour la paix, travaillons pour que la paix règne sur toute l’étendue du territoire national.

Thuram has become increasingly linked with a move to Merseyside in recent weeks as he has now been earmarked as a target for side.

I was with his big brother in the training centre, but I saw him grow. I saw him perform and progress at a level... It was incredible. Even when he came to the France team for his first selection. I saw him at the training and I was really surprised by his size and his technical ease. \"When I was in Leipzig and I signed for Liverpool, many people said that it was too early, that it was not the right choice. In the end, I proved all these people wrong so you shouldn't listen to people. If Khephren has the opportunity to come to a club like Liverpool, I think he will be surprised the enthusiasm that will come behind him. \"It's up to him to work.
